Didn''t realize it would munge the HTML so poorly.  And look at the actual URL for the HTML spec, don''t read what I have quoted since the tags won''t show up right. Updated by Nisheeth Ranjan (nisheeth@netscape.com) on Sunday, April 26, 1998 6:24:39 PM PDT Additional Details : <Q> is a new tag in HTML 4.0 for marking inline quotations (<BLOCKQUOTE> marks block level quotations), support for which has not been added to Mozilla yet. It should be pretty simple to add, however.  Brian, thanks a lots for reporting this bug.  Do you want to take a crack at fixing it?  If so, I'll email you details of how to start and assign the bug to you.

So, do you think you still have time to add the <Q> tag to mozilla?  If so, take a look at lib/libparse/pa_tags.h and lib/layout/laytags.c.  Shoot if you have any questions.  I think raptor is going to support <Q> tag from the first release because it will implement HTML 4.0.","id":121,"bug_id":111,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Oct 13 09:02:59 EEST 1998","creator":"nisheeth_mozilla@yahoo.com","author":"nisheeth_mozilla@yahoo.com","time":"Tue Oct 13 09:02:59 EEST 1998","text":"Changing component to layout.","id":122,"bug_id":111,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Dec 15 07:17:59 EET 1998","creator":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Dec 15 07:17:59 EET 1998","text":"Old bug, old codebase.
