It can't seem to find those two images, even though they display properly in other browsers. This has been present since the first source release. I'm currently using today's (06/08/98) build. Updated by   (rob@gadgetguru.com) on Wednesday, June 10, 1998 11:14:04 AM PDT Additional Details : Additional investigation shows that Mozilla is having a problem with the redirections given by Apache's mod_speling module. The graphic mtop.gif was incorrectly referenced on the page as MTop.gif, mod_speling attempted to correct the error and redirect to the correct image, but Mozilla didn't take the redirection.","id":1098,"bug_id":436,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Oct 09 21:48:59 EEST 1998","creator":"pnunn@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"pnunn@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Oct 09 21:48:59 EEST 1998","text":"I just checked this page with todays build and the images are displaying fine.
