Maybe this is not really a bug, but shouldn''t asserts only fail on things that should never, ever happen, not normal error conditions? Updated by Steve Lamm (slamm@netscape.com) on Thursday, April 30, 1998 10:45:00 AM PDT Additional Details : We need to add some logic that only allows you to run one Browser at a time, or that makes the addition Browsers read-only.  If you do need to run two at once, you can create a second home directory.  I usually test in a extra home directory.  For instance,  setenv HOME /u/slamm/.testhome  For starters, we could modify the code that pops up the lock dialog to popup a dialog explaining the situation and then quiting.  We should probably allow people to force the lock to go away too.","id":344,"bug_id":177,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Sep 09 16:41:59 EEST 1998","creator":"slamm@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"slamm@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Sep 09 16:41:59 EEST 1998","text":"Marking Assigned.","id":345,"bug_id":177,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Dec 15 07:20:59 EET 1998","creator":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Dec 15 07:20:59 EET 1998","text":"Is this bug still valid in the new world?
