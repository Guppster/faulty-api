This behaviour is same in 4.x and 4.5. I checked the same code with \"appletviewer\" and as well as console application, in both the case it works fine. The same applet works fine if I load it from Netscape running on Windows where the native library is in the form of DLL. The Native library is not using any system call, it is a simple example which returns a \"NewStringUTF\".  This is a potential bug with Netscape browsers. If required I can send the sample programs.
