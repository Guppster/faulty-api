Nowadays you've got so much going on in this mutating app that even at exit there are threads running, accessing things which other threads do their politest to clean up and destroy. With all these threads running you must find a way of synchronising the ExitProcess call, either directly or indirectly, by waiting on all running threads to exit, signalling them first of the shutdown. Several times your app has actually been running in the background, totally invisible, several seconds realtime after it disappeared from the screen. In this case if it is opened again, one of three things can result (so far): 1.) It just doesn't open. Period. 2.) It opens and disappears just as fast - like a flash on the screen. 3.) (Most often) - it crashes ALL OVER THE PLACE. These successive crashes, caused by the structured exception handling, show something is DIRELY wrong, A.) You have no build-in handler at all, B.) some thread is accessing something which has been removed from you process page tables subsequent to the DestroyWindow and its follow-ups.
