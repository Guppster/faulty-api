If the 'align' attribute is to  be equated to the 'text-align' property, this contradicts the above secion of  CSS2.  Mozilla's current behavior complies with the CSS2 spec, however because the  'align' attribute does not inherit from COL/COLGROUP, it violates the HTML4  spec.  Restricting column inheritance to such a narrow group of properties also appears  to violate the intended purpose of the COL element, namely \"The COL element  allows authors to share attributes among several columns without implying any  structural grouping.\"  Limiting the 'attributes' to those specified by CSS2  greatly reduces the usefulness of COL/COLGROUP.

All CSS properites that have \"Applies to: ALL\" should apply to COL and COLGROUP.   HTML4 specification section 11.3.2 describes an order of precedence for inheriting attributes (VALIGN, LANG, DIR, STYLE) by content and children of TD such as P.  NOTE there is a different order of precedence for attributes ALIGN, CHAR, and CHAROFF. This order of precedence should apply to all CSS properties that have \"inheritence: YES\".    And to be perfectly clear, all CSS properties that have \"inheritence: YES\" and \"Applies to: ALL\" should apply to all HTML table elements (including TABLE, COLGROUP, COL, TBODY, TR, TD) so they may be inherited by the content and children of TD.  That is my proposal.  I think this bug should be fixed for Mozilla 1.2 if not sooner.  I agree with comment #81.  You cannot apply a strict tree model for inheritance in a table because a table is fundamentally a matrix (2D), not a linear tree. Otherwise it's just a fancy list of lists.  Apparently the folks at Microsoft agree.  What about CSS2 section 17.3?  I think the properties listed there (BORDER, BACKGROUND, WIDTH, VISIBILITY) are intended to apply to the column as a whole element and probably not be inherited.  Infact, CSS2 explicitly describes this for BACKGROUND and I think the same behaviour should work for BORDER.  Therefore this section excludes ONLY these properties from inheritance by TD.

Thank you for referring me to section 6.2 of CSS2.  After re-reading the definition of the document tree and the inheritance rules, I now understand why this behavior is not valid CSS2.    This is in response to comment #84 asking for a proposal for how things *should* work so that it could be discussed.    In the scope of HTML, I think TD *should* behave this way regardless of what CSS2 says.  HTML4 is not perfect. CSS2 is not perfect.  They disagree on TD.  Therefore a \"better\" browser may choose the \"better\" way of doing things.  Yes, this opens the pandora's box of opinions on what is \"better\".  Maybe it contradicts CSS2, but IE sets a precedent that makes very good sense to me.  The HTML4/CSS2 model is supposed to separate the structure of a document from it's stylistic formatting.  So why does CSS2 impose the structural rule that each element may have exactly one parent?  With this rule in place CSS2 is inadequate to style the contexts of a two-dimensional table.  HTML is supposed to describe the structure of a document, and it says a TD can inherit style from more than one \"parent\" element.    Regarding document structure, I think (X)HTML should trump CSS2.  Besides, common sense agrees with HTML4 and not CSS2.  A TD element needs to have two \"parents\" in order to illustrate it's relationship to the two axes of the table.  TD and TH may be unique in HTML in this respect.  One \"parent\" has priority over the other.  HTML specifies that rows trump columns.

Re:comment #86: \"TD inherits from COL if there is nothing on  TR which comes down to a regular inheritance chain COL -> TR -> TD\". How about letting only text-align inherit from COL and COLGROUP and let vertical-align inherit from TR? That's how I would implement this. There would be no conflict to resolve.  Re: comment#100: One \"parent\" has priority over the other.  HTML specifies that rows trump columns. I believe this is what CSS2 also says when both x and y axis are involved like borders. Here's an illustration of this in 17.6.2: \"If border styles differ only in color, then a style set on a cell wins over one on a row, which wins over a row group, column, column group and, lastly, table\"  I agree also that HTML align is quite different from the css property text-align. HTML align often implies positioning the element within its immediate parent node; text-align implies text alignment of the text node within the node. The css equivalent of HTML align in block-level elements involves the margin property, not text-align. So, within this way of definition terms, within this frame of understanding, <col align=\"left|center|right|justify|char\"> does not strike me as \"natural\". I believe this whole issue would be a lot easier to solve if HTML align, char, charoff attributes would be deprecated for COL, COLGROUP and TR and css properties only would be applied. I would also deprecate valign for COL, COLGROUP and TR.  HTML COL         CSS prop.

CSS prop. text-align and text-indent would apply to COL, COLGROUP only while vertical-align would apply to TR only. (Of course the TDs would have the final word in the inheritance propagation on text-align, text-indent, vertical-align properties.)  In other words, a text-align property applied to a td would only inherit from its COL or COLGROUP while a vertical-align proprerty applied to a td would only inherit from its TR.

Since the feature in question has been deprecated for some six years, rearchitecting Mozilla so that fixing this becomes possible without such a high cost is not a high priority.  Note that Mozilla is not an HTML user agent, it is a CSS user agent that happens to have knwoledge of some HTML semantics. Thus when the two specifications conflict, as they do in this case, CSS has priority in deciding for which specification the design should be optimised.  Also note that IE's support of this property is at the cost of not implementing a large section of CSS2. I explained this in more detail on my blog once:     http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1070385285&count=1  (Note to possible volunteers: IE does not follow the HTML specification on this any more than it follows the CSS specification, but in this case it is likely that if you just implemented what IE does as far as these attributes go, and did not do the full HTML-spec version, the patch would still be accepted.)  The number of votes on this bug will not affect whether this bug is fixed or not. Nor will high numbers of duplicates. We know it is a major bug, that's why so many people have tried to fix it.

The whole problem is that  it's > not possible in the CSS to inherit from more than one parent and nobody has > described anything resembling a vaguely sensible way of doing so.  The whole of CSS involves cascading through multiple parents - whole ancestral  hierarchies. Moreover, these hierarchies are complex, as ancestors may receive  attributes through various types of rules of varying specificity. This \"it's  not possible\" (like most!) is I think designed to stifle rather than to  encourage creative discussion.  With the complex inheritance picture in CSS, surely the issue is one of  priorities. CSS already has procedures for resolving priorities; for example,  an attribute prescribed by a more remote ancestor may be overridden by a more  proximal one (e.g. a DIV attribute may be overridden by a P attribute).  As many commentators have said, COLs and COLGROUPs complicate the picture  because they don't fit the DOM tree like other CSS properties. Nevertheless,  they do provide a natural way to prescribe those horizontal layout properties,  i.e. width and alignment, that programmers need to provide in tablular reports.  Some of us, who have to do a lot of tabular reports and who don't like writing  repetitive cell-by-cell alignment attributes on every line of an n-line table,  take the view that COL or COLGROUP is the natural way to do these things.   So, what is the problem? In particular, if COL can be implemented for width (as  the powers-that-be have decreed it should), what is the problem with  implementing it for alignment also?  To claim (as has been claimed for years in this topic) that this is an  inheritance problem seems to me unfounded.  If it is an inheritance problem, why can COL and COLGROUP be successfully used  to specify width?  And what is this inheritance problem that uniquely affects alignment? - Let me  see if I have this straight. Consider the example:  Assumption 1: Cell (3, 2) is at column 3, row 2. Assumption 2: Column 3 prescribes text-align right. Assumption 3: Row 2 prescribes text-align left.  If I understand the inheritance problem correctly, then Cell (3,2) could  arguably be left-aligned (inheriting from Row 2) or right-aligned (inheriting  from Column 3).  Baron et al seem to be alleging that in the absence of a definitive ruling from  W3C, there is absolutely nothing that a user agent (e.g. Mozilla) can  reasonably do except wash its hands of the whole business and wait for  interminable deliberations of the appropriate international committees.  Yet several previous commentators have pointed out that one could use some  consistent principles of logic, e.g. that COL has precedence over TR on  horizontal attributes (e.g. width, text-align) while TR has precedence on  vertical ones (e.g. height, vertical-align).  But first of all, let's consider the (usual, in fact typical) situation where  there is no conflict between row attributes and column attributes on column  width or alignment.  Although COL cuts across the DOM tree - columns intriniscally do - as a matter  of fact all user agents already manage to harmonize respective column widths  from row to row; so if it is not beyond the wit of man to give them equal  width, why not common colour or alignment? What deep conceptual or inheritance  problem was overcome in order to manage equal column widths on every row? why  can that conceptual or inheritance problem not be solved for other attributes?  But what if there is a conflict? What if the row prescribes attributes that  conflict with the column attributes?  I (and I suspect many others who have contributed to this topic) don't care. If  the inheritance rules are stupid or awkward or unpredictable, I don't care. If  one user agent does it one way, and another does it another, I don't care.  Because at the end of the day, if I prescribe row properties that conflict with  column properties, then it lies within my power to stop doing so.","id":2180208,"bug_id":915,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Jun 19 01:03:40 EEST 2004","creator":"dbaron@dbaron.org","author":"dbaron@dbaron.org","time":"Sat Jun 19 01:03:40 EEST 2004","text":"(In reply to comment #178) > The whole of CSS involves cascading through multiple parents - whole ancestral   Elements never have multiple parents.

The width property doesn't get applied to the cell at all. It only affects the cell because when we're actually calculating the layout, we do a width calculation across the whole column, and both the cell and column widths get accounted for during that stage. The align property needs to be *applied* to the cell in order to affect its content, and styles only get applied to the cell before layout -- before we know which cell is in which column. Similar logic applies to background: the background doesn't get applied to the cell, it's a box that gets painted *underneath* /all/ the cells. You can see this by setting an image background on the column and then telling the cells to be transparent: the image background will show through the transparent cell background as one long picture that spans the cells.","id":2182308,"bug_id":915,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Jun 22 00:02:30 EEST 2004","creator":"malichus@mac.com","author":"malichus@mac.com","time":"Tue Jun 22 00:02:30 EEST 2004","text":"What sort of algorithm is it which \"applies the style\"?

Well, the problem why COL stylea re not applied to a cell seems to be because  a cell is not a descendant of that COL and it's not easy (or possible) to  apply a style that's not inherited. But a 5th cell also looks at more than its  parent when calculating its style, now why exactly is looking at a column more  difficult than looking at how many child nodes does a cell's parent have?

I have read all of the comments on this bug, and fully understand the issues involved, originating with the CSS single inheritance model and exacerbated by the lack of clarity in the CSS specifications about how this particular case should be handled.  With respect to what should be done, I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments expressed in comment #100 (and elsewhere): > Regarding document structure, I think (X)HTML should trump CSS2 and > I could live with an exception for (X)HTML, but not just for alignment. It > should be for every CSS1(2?) property that applies to all elements and that > inherits, unless there are some properties that should not be included for > specific reasons. Styles defined on COLs and COLGROUPs should affect the table cells in those columns.  ALL appropriate (inheritable) styles, be they approved in CSS2 17.3 (like 'border', 'background', 'width', and 'visibility') or not (like 'text-align', 'font', 'z-index', even the aural properties and preferably also 'display:none').  With respect to tables, CSS2 6.1.1 and 6.2 are an incorrect adaptation of document structure.  CSS3's ':nth-child' psuedo class is an inadequate workaround, because of cells that span multiple columns.  But common sense (and HTML4) dictates that CSS2 and CSS3 must be overridden here; tables are two dimensional structures and table cells are contained by both rows and columns.  IE understands this and Mozilla should too.  This way, we honor the intended purpose of COLs and COLGROUPs while still separating content (HTML elements) from style (CSS rules).  Once you decide that HTML4 should trump CSS structure but not CSS rules, then the issue becomes how to apply the update in a logical, efficient, and minimally changed manner.  The idea presented in comment #186 is to modify the DOM tree for applying CSS rules (in other words, to create a pseudo-tree for TABLEs): > <table> >    <tbody> >       <tr> >          <colgroup> >             <col> >                <td> ... <\/td> >             <\/col> >          <\/colgroup> >       <\/tr> >    <\/tbody> > <\/table> This would work, but it involves a non-trivial change on every table and breaks the symmetry between DOM structure and CSS ancestry.  I vote for the method suggested in comment #175 and comment #191, that is, treating COLs and COLGROUPs more as attributes of TABLEs than as independent elements. comment #175: > The difficulty seems to stem from the desire to have styles on a table cell > inherited from a col tag that is not an ancestor of the cell in the document > object tree.  Is it at all possible to make the col tag behave less like a > separate element and more like an attribute of the parent table element that > contains it?

Any thoughts on that? comment #191: > Would it be possible to treat the COL/COLGROUP alignment info as if it were an > attribute (array) of the TABLE itself?

The inability of COLGROUPs to contain anything but COLs and the inability of COLs to contain anything at all lend credibility to treating them as attributes of TABLEs... indeed, this seems to be their purpose.  Programmatically, it doesn't seem like this change would affect very much.  It would probably be the most efficient change in terms of processor cycles, and would only take up more memory where more would be needed anyway (when COLGROUPs and/or COLs are specified).  It honors the intent of both HTML4 and CSS2, and would even work for the CSS 'table-column' and 'table-column-group' display properties.  Well, I think my proposal is finished.

All this talk about how the  rules of CSS inheritance should be interpretted is really becoming annoying,  so let me add to the debate my throwing in my two penny's worth.  AFAIAW the rules of CSS inheritance are quite clear. You may specify style at  various levels, and entries at lower levels override anything specified at a  higher level. Thus within an HTML document style may be specified at any of  the following levels:  (1) Browser defaults (Why are they all different? Why are they never  documented?) (2) External stylesheets (from CSS files). (3) Internal stylesheets (between <style>..<\/style> tags). (4) At the individual tag level.  It is therefore quite clear to me that anything specified within a COLGROUP  tag overrides ANY previous specification, and it may only be overridden itself  by other specifications within that particular table. Thus if I specify  <colgroup valign=\"top\"> I expect all relevant cells to be aligned at the top  (regardless of any current setting for TD tags) UNLESS I specify something  different on a particular TD tag.  Also bear in mind that the rules of CSS inheritance can only be strictly  applied in XHTML documents where inline style is disallowed. As HTML documents  can have a mixture of both then you must deal with that mixture and apply the  style in the order in which it was specified, which may be from a mixture of  stylesheet and tag info.  As a final point, regardless of how any individual *thinks* the rules should  be interpretted, you should start by being consistent with other browsers.","id":2311740,"bug_id":915,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Oct 30 13:10:15 EEST 2004","creator":"chris.tipper@gmail.com","author":"chris.tipper@gmail.com","time":"Sat Oct 30 13:10:15 EEST 2004","text":"Please put us out of our misery.

I'm not concerned about how easy or not it is to implememnt. That's your job.  The HTML specification clearly states the order of precedence, so I expect a  standards-compliant browser to follow that order.

No doubt the rules in the HTML or CSS specifications do give some kind of order  of precedence. Maybe the specifications are ambiguous.  But many of the people who write web pages, and generate data tables on a  terrifying scale, are actually very simple people who want to write simple code  that doesn't exploit subtleties in the inheritance hierarchy. We keep our  styles simple, specific and well-targeted. We ensure that our elements aren't  larded with lots of overriding styles that might come out this way on one  browser, and that way on another.  In particular, when producing a table, I (and other simple souls like me) are  never ever going to play precedence games with the alignment of a column. And  if we do, and things didn't go right, we would think that we had only ourselves  to blame. If I have a column with four columns of text and one of numbers, I  want the numbers right-aligned and the text left-aligned; and firing out td  elements with alignment styles on each and every one of N rows times M columns  just goes against our simple-minded principles, and we feel that (X)HTML plus  CSS ought to be able to go one better.  We pea-brains do not understand why, when we do not want our browsers to  distinguish complex inheritance rules that we ourselves cannot understand and  frankly have better things to do, they cannot even understand basic  instructions. Thus, when I have absolutely no styles whatever in my document  except that I specify right-alignment for a numeric column via a col or  colgroup element, I rate a browser that totally ignores my directives as  inferior to one that tries to carry them out, however imperfectly.  So what I am suggesting is that if Mozilla did the smallest, meanest, measliest  thing towards recognizing a col attribute and applying it, then even if it flew  in the face of abstruse precedence rules, I would be content, because I can  always construct my XHTML to avoid reliance on precedence rules.  And I think it's important not to lose sight of the purpose of (X)HTML, which  is to present information. People like myself who are furiously polluting the  web with data for (ugh!) ordinary consumers are actually trying to supply good- looking accessible information first, and while we all no doubt like to follow  standards and get one of those nice W3C tick-mark or check-box logos on our  pages, that is a means to an end. We want something that works cleanly and well  and is easily maintainable.  When the quest for perfect fulfilment of standards actually frustrates us who  are trying to get them to work for us, it seems to me that there is something  self-defeating going on. When, for example, I read (as I seem to do here) that  it is reasonable of me to expect that I can control colour or background via a  col element, but if I want alignment too then I am a simpleton who needs a  smack on the head, I just feel we are losing touch with reality. It's like  having a car with a steering-wheel that works the automatic indicators OK, but  doesn't actually change the vehicle's direction. Stupid boy.  Finally, I prefer to work with something that tries to get it right, rather  than something that doesn't try for fear of getting it wrong. The point of a  browser is to be usable, isn't it, rather than to satisfy a small committee of  gurus?  I apologize for my last stroppy antagonistic post. But I really do think that a  change of priorities is called for.","id":2312455,"bug_id":915,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sun Oct 31 04:44:21 EET 2004","creator":"dbaron@dbaron.org","author":"dbaron@dbaron.org","time":"Sun Oct 31 04:44:21 EET 2004","text":"None of the solutions proposed is easy to implement.

Ok, so for the \"correct\" solution here (which is apparently hard to implement), if someone comes up with a patch to do it that way, will it get checked in?  Comment 131 seems to indicate yes, but the general tone of the comments from Mozilla devs on this bug seems to contradict that: I feel like any patch submitted will either \"touch too many parts of the code\" or \"be too complicated\", and be rejected on intangible, highly-subjective grounds.  As someone else has remarked, if this bug really isn't going to be fixed, please mark it as WONTFIX so we can all stop wasting time here.  If a fix _is_ possible and likely, then my question to all the people CCed on this bug is this: is there someone capable and willing who can write a patch implementing the fix as dbaron has described?  If so, speak up, and get to work.  It seems to me that it's pretty clear how dbaron (et al.) want this bug fixed, and arguing isn't going to do a thing about it, so if you're not capable and willing, there's no reason for you to add another comment to this bug.

It is a minor technicality, whether this is done through the HTML parser or the CSS engine, or using some other hack, as long as there is at least *some* way.  It cannot be that the only way to get all cells in a single column of a table centered is to add some HTML attribute to *each* *single* td element. This is ridiculous! I do not know of any other self-respecting text-rendering language that has no way of specifying per-colum alignment attributes for tables.  The cleanest thing, to me, would seem that *all* HTML attributes of <col> become the default for all the <td> elements in that column. Then I can set a class=... attribute in <col>, and the CSS engine can pick that up from the <td> element and act on it. Remember: There is *no* other purpose at all for <col> than to inherit attributes onto <td> (and <th>) elements. So obviously the only sensible thing to do here is to inherit *all* attributes from <col> to <td>.

So, here's my idea:   Why not implement a \":nth-column()\" psuedo-class, that works just like :nth- child, *EXCEPT* that for TD and TH elements it takes into account the COLSPAN  values of their preceding siblings?  It couldn't possibly be hard to do that!  I think it would be really useful just on its own as an addition to CSS, for  styling tables... but the real point of my mentioning it here is that (I'm guessing) Mozilla  could use it to implement COL and COLGROUP functionality, *** by internally  translating the attributes on these tags into style rules using this new  pseudo-selector ***, and assigning these rules an appropriate specificity.  As I said, I don't know anything about Mozilla internals, so I may be way off  base here.  Also, it's not a perfect solution in any case, since  (a) The \"align\" attribute doesn't quite translate to the \"text-align\" style,  or to any other CSS styles exactly, so the results could not quite be made to  match the HTML4 specifications.  and  (b) As far as I can see this technique couldn't be used to deal with CLASS  attributes on COL or COLGROUP tags (i.e. they should ideally work the same way  as CLASS attributes on the TR tag or other ancestor tags).  Still, for all the people out there who are obviously desperate for some way  to apply alignment and other styles to tables on a per-column basis, this  solution would be MUCH better than doing nothing!  So, what do the gurus say - could this idea fly? or is it inherently flawed  somehow? Is it as easy to implement as it sounds?  At the very least, I hope I might have provoked some more thought on how to  fix this problem!","id":2619169,"bug_id":915,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Sep 22 21:47:39 EEST 2005","creator":"dbaron@dbaron.org","author":"dbaron@dbaron.org","time":"Thu Sep 22 21:47:39 EEST 2005","text":"It's not inherently flawed, and I've proposed it elsewhere ( http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2005Jul/0121 ), but it wouldn't actually fix this bug, so it belongs in another bug.","id":2619177,"bug_id":915,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Sep 22 22:35:02 EEST 2005","creator":"dbaron@dbaron.org","author":"dbaron@dbaron.org","time":"Thu Sep 22 22:35:02 EEST 2005","text":"Malcom, I'm thinking of looking into this.

Is someone waiting for W3C to declare TABLE et al. to be \"deprecated\"? Or maybe a new category is needed, e.g., \"passé\" ...   I found Comment #162, and the linked blog, to be a good statement of the problem (at least if you don't know anything about Gecko internals), and #219 is a good description of the requirement.  Comment #250 suggests a good solution using CSS terms.  While it may offend some CSS purists, here is my take on a solution:  The key, of course, is this:  \"If it's a table, map out its structure.\"  The problem is that if you do it too late, there's nothing left to inherit, while if  you do it too early, inheritance might change the structure.  This is a problem only if you define it too broadly.  In the following, feel free to substitute \"element with display:table-column\" for COL, etc.; this could work independently of tag names.   1.  Since any COLGROUP or COL must appear before rows, the number of columns is determined first (if none defined, no problem!).  This can be performed before or after the CSS cascade, since columns aren't CSS parents.  2.  Implement an HTMLColumns collection, creating implied COL elements for COLGROUPs and spanned columns, or a range of columns for each COL.  3.  For each table cell, define a columnIndex attribute (and an entityReference to its column, if necessary for performance).  If it spans columns, its columnIndex is that of the first column it's in.  4.  \"Perform inheritance of properties, inheriting magically from table columns if the column isn't inheriting its style itself.\" A choice exists: If there were no COL elements, there is no Columns collection and no columnIndex.  Conversely, the Columns collection is created from the implied columns, but inherits only the columns' widths, and only if the first row's cells can define widths (similar to the criteria for \"table-layout: fixed\").  (In trying to get similar results from FF and IE, I've noticed that FF is very shy about honoring \"table-layout: fixed;\" and this thread makes it very clear why...)  I'm sure I've missed something here, but this looks to me like an enhancement for inheritance.  If, at any point, an attribute of any cell is redefined so as to break this scheme, just exclude the cell from any column inheritance.  If it's preferable to restrict the CSS attributes to \"easy\" ones, just document it.","id":2857740,"bug_id":915,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sun Sep 17 08:32:33 EEST 2006","creator":"hyatt@mozilla.org","author":"hyatt@mozilla.org","time":"Sun Sep 17 08:32:33 EEST 2006","text":"Corresponding Safari/WebKit bug is  http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3241 ","id":2984644,"bug_id":915,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Sep 27 00:14:56 EEST 2006","creator":"bugzilla-graveyard@chrislawson.net","author":"bugzilla-graveyard@chrislawson.net","time":"Wed Sep 27 00:14:56 EEST 2006","text":"*** Bug 354342 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***","id":2995009,"bug_id":915,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Oct 25 15:56:36 EEST 2006","creator":"ryan@ryancannon.com","author":"ryan@ryancannon.com","time":"Wed Oct 25 15:56:36 EEST 2006","text":"(In reply to comment #272) Webkit is no longer hosted at opendarwin.org.

We need to keep the frame cellmap (the one in layout/tables/) working exactly the way it does now, but add (for this code) a content cellmap, constructed lazily only when needed, that allows determining which *semantic* column a table cell is in (accounting for rowspan and colspan attributes in the markup -- note that in the future the frame cellmap may have to account for row-span and column-span CSS properties, but the content cellmap should not).  I suspect making it a template class may be the right way to do that, but I haven't looked into it in any detail.  They should use exactly the same algorithm for determining which row/column cells are in, but they should get the data about table structure (and, eventually, row and column spans) from different sources.  Once that code is written, the patch here could be fixed up and landed, and we could also implement semantic column selectors (such as the proposal in bug 371323).  That is a good bit of work, and I'd hoped that one of the (at least one, maybe more than one -- I don't have time to read all 288 comments right now to refresh my memory) people who'd claimed to have a patch to fix this would have implemented it, but nobody has that code, and writing it isn't at the top of my priority list.  (Just because something was published earlier doesn't mean it's actually more useful for Web authors.  That the spec in question is as poorly written and unclear as it is is perhaps a sign that it isn't useful, and that implementations aren't likely to do the same thing once it is implemented.  Given that Safari/WebKit doesn't do this either, we're not the only ones holding authors back from using the feature (which is more of a factor than the age of the specification).)  Just because it's not at the top of my list right now doesn't mean I'll never get back to working on it -- it's *on* my list.  But if somebody else wants to do the remaining piece, you're welcome to.   I'd also note that adding comments does NOT help -- it just makes this bug harder to understand.  For example, somebody coming along who wants to finish this is already pretty unlikely to find this comment explaining what's left to do, and the more comments that are added, the less likely they are to find it.","id":3560457,"bug_id":915,"tags":["important"]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu May 01 23:47:36 EEST 2008","creator":"johnbrown105@hotmail.com","author":"johnbrown105@hotmail.com","attachment_id":318932,"time":"Thu May 01 23:47:36 EEST 2008","text":"Created attachment 318932 HTML file showing that Firefox does not honour <col valign=\"top\">   Just view the HTML file in Firefox.

I don't understand this statement. You know which cell is in which column based purely on the HTML structure and HTML attributes (colspan, etc.). Column membership is a function of the original HTML document structure, not layout. If I go and do something stupid with CSS like say columns should be displayed as flying monkeys, it doesn't matter at that point. It has no effect on the fact that <td> should inherit its HTML align attribute from the <col> to which it belongs.  Maybe this was in reference to the 4 CSS styles (17.3) which should be inherited via the column/column group \"context\". Again, I think this is still structural inheritance that doesn't require \"layout\" to assign cells to columns. The CSS spec even seems to imply structure when it says \"in the source document cells are descendants of rows, never of columns\".

None, for the column determination that needs to happen here.  All workable proposals for column-based styling choose what cells get the styles based on the column semantics in the markup.  If the author causes the display to be something else by using the 'display' property (or, in the future, the 'row-span' or 'column-span' properties), that's their problem.

The goal of HTML5 is to standardize how all versions of HTML is parsed, based on what has already been implemented in the real world. The majority of the HTML5 standard is stable, and thus implementable. Very few browsers have implemented this portion of the old HTML4 standard, and it was likely decided that it was either too hard to implement or is really presentational (i.e. more suited for CSS). Based on that, I can understand why this bug was marked as INVALID.  However, I do believe that the idea behind this bug would still be useful\u2014I would very much like to be able to style <col> and <colgroup>, including alignment, if necessary.","id":4885786,"bug_id":915,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Aug 24 14:08:00 EEST 2010","creator":"paul.lebeau@gmail.com","author":"paul.lebeau@gmail.com","time":"Tue Aug 24 14:08:00 EEST 2010","text":"R.I.P.

Opera also supports this clearly-defined portion of the HTML4 spec. The other two main browsers on the market run off the same rendering engine, and there's a long-standing open bug report for that engine (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3241) that is apparently waiting on action from Firefox. So it is an absolute cop-out to say \"it's not in the HTML5 spec yet and the spec represents support in current browsers so it shouldn't be there because it's not widely supported\", when you really mean to say \"we don't support it, so we think it shouldn't be in the spec to begin with\".  Shoving this feature off to be handled in CSS is NOT a good catch-all solution. It is a nightmare to do this if alignment needs to be changed on-the-fly via Javascript, or if the stylesheet for the page is inaccessible to a table independently created by a different process. Pushing the alignment down to an attribute on the cell is bulky, inefficient, and, all things considered, absolutely unnecessary, if we could rely on the col align feature in the HTML4 spec to begin with.  I hate to sound like a broken record, given the history in this thread, but COME ON. It's because of stupid little things like this that companies (mainly business-related web software) still require their users to use Internet Explorer for their pages - not necessarily because those companies are antiquated and averse to change, but because Internet Explorer JUST WORKS for this, and it's important to their users.

Although Birds shared many characteristics with other Life Forms, the specified combination of form and functions was unique.  Whereas Birds and Fish both lay eggs, Birds survive only in air and Fish only in water.  Similarly, Birds and Alligators both have scaly legs, but alligators have scales everywhere, Birds only on their legs.  And, as everyone knows, Birds and gnats both fly, but no one would confuse the latter with the former.  Then the Developer (aka \"Mother Nature\") instantiated what is now known as the \"Ostrich\" (original name lost in antiquity).  Like other Birds, the Ostrich lays eggs, survives only in air, has scaly legs and is otherwise covered in feathers; flying, however, is problematic.  Despite being generally considered to be compliant with the original Bird Specification, this feature was not fully implemented by the Developer in this instantiation.  Now, along comes a User desirous of taking advantage of the specified flight characteristic of Birds in her flock/covey/herd of Ostriches.  It is quite doubtful that she will be content to accept the excuse from the Developer that \"flight was included in error in the original Bird Specification.\"  Nor will \"flight should have been indicated as a optional feature in the original Bird Specification\" be deemed acceptable.  Further, it will be of no consolation to the User for the Developer to suggest that \"perhaps your bird [lower case] might be capable of, say, soaring if you could induce it to run sufficiently fast while holding out what passes for its wings ... or perhaps with a modest JATO pack.\"  It might be anticipated that apologists for the Developer would put forth the justification that \"your birds [again lower case] were specially adapted so as to run as fast as most Birds [upper case] fly, so you should be satisfied ... and, besides, future instantiations of Ostriches may be capable of self-sustained flight.\"  Alas, what is the Developer to do when the User continues to insist on full compliance with the original Bird Specification?

Well, the <COL> group makes a lot of sense to tabular data presentation anyway. And it seems that it doesn't make any sense without it being fully implemented.  But guys, read the previous (very old) comments. It seems there's been a number of unsuccessful fix attempts in the past.

I'm definitely not willing to try myself to persuade the W3C to re-include align/valign/etc. in the HTML5 spec, and I don't know what debates have taken place within the working group on this topic, but think of it this way: if HTML5 is supposed to be a spec based on the current support of HTML5 in modern browsers, don't you think it could possibly change their mind if a real implementation was made by Mozilla and then followed by WebKit? That would mean support in all 5 of the major modern browsers, and then maybe there would be a stronger reason to reinclude it in HTML5.

This isn't useful.  comment 288 describes exactly the work that remains to be done.

I understand that as a volunteer contributor to an open-source project, the type of work that you are interested in doing does affect what makes it into the end product. On that note, I read the spec in the proposed selectors4 draft for :column(). I'd like to encourage you to pursue that implementation. I think that doing so will help both of us. It seems to be defined well enough from a CSS perspective to let you write it in a way that is compatible with the rest of your CSS engine. Once you have a :-moz-column() pseudo-class selector in place, couldn't you just add this set of rules to the internal Mozilla default stylesheet?  :-moz-column(col[align=\"left\"     ]) { text-align: left   ; } :-moz-column(col[align=\"center\"   ]) { text-align: center ; } :-moz-column(col[align=\"right\"    ]) { text-align: right  ; } :-moz-column(col[align=\"justify\"  ]) { text-align: justify; } :-moz-column(col[valign=\"top\"     ]) { vertical-align: top     ; } :-moz-column(col[valign=\"middle\"  ]) { vertical-align: middle  ; } :-moz-column(col[valign=\"bottom\"  ]) { vertical-align: bottom  ; } :-moz-column(col[valign=\"baseline\"]) { vertical-align: baseline; }  Similar rules could be added for align/valign in colgroups: :-moz-column(colgroup[align=\"left\"] > col) { text-align: left; }  The downsides I see with this approach: - it wouldn't cover align=\"char\" and charoff - I don't know if it'd be possible to handle cols with span defined - assigning styles directly to the <col> element (e.g. col.style.textAlign = \"center\") wouldn't update the style  The upsides to this approach: - it'd probably be good enough for most of the people in this thread - it would be fairly harmless to add at that point (via the default stylesheet) - it would finally bring an end to 13 years of fighting over this damn bug.

Scott, your remark seems to me to make a lot of sense. Pretty much. Maybe not in the solution itself, but rather in its philosophy. I mean, the missing parts you mentioned would need some extra programmatic approach, like linking (default, built-in) Javascript procedures to default CSS.  A few facts. 1. HTML4 documents and applications won't vanish overnight once HTML5 will be a standard. A better support to HTML4 will make the web a better place.  2. W3C standards have proven not to be bullet proof (among the most recent cases: http://it.slashdot.org/story/11/10/22/0310230/xml-encryption-broken-need-to-fix-w3c-standard).  3. Smart interpretation (of standards) and implementation (of browsers) in the mid- long-term are better than strict ones.
