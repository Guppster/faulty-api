(i.e. what are the floating image problems that were taking place?)  www.amazon.com renders beautifully on Mac OS/Win32/Linux (1.22.99 Mac OS/Linux, and 1.21.99 Win32 builds)  www.scea.sony.com has table problems (table is horizontally way too wide, images are quite a bit off to the right of the table, and text overlaps with the lefthand edge of the text.)  But, I'm marking the bug as verified, since amazon works, and the problems on www.scea.sony.com are ones that I think I've seen covered in other bug reports.","id":2016,"bug_id":628,"tags":[]}]}
