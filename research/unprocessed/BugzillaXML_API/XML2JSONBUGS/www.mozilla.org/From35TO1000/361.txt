If it is preceded      by any of the other label options then the parse for the extension and the label fails. I tracked this down to the fact      that the single label object is closed when the processing for any option completes. The problem was in      CSLABEL.C, about line 245 in the table definition for SingleLabel_stateTokens element \"option value\". The next      to last specification containing the command was Command_CLOSE and it should be Command_NONE.    2.Multiple ratings in a single label are parsed without errors but the structures to iterate through the multiple single      labels are not set up correctly. This prevents Mozilla from creating standalone labels from a single label      containing multiple ratings. Creating standalone labels is needed for processing of signed labels. I found this in      the C reference code, not the Mozilla code, but Mozilla probably has the problem also. It does not affect the trust      label processing because that does not depend on the ability to iterate through the parsing structures.    8.If you have an extension option, the parser does not correctly finish the parse on the label when it sees the      closing paren after ratings. If you remove the extension option the parser detects the closing paren correctly and      returns _done status.","id":916,"bug_id":361,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Sep 08 20:59:59 EEST 1998","creator":"gagan@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"gagan@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Sep 08 20:59:59 EEST 1998","text":"Assigning to DP, till a more \"dedicated\" PICS owner is found.","id":917,"bug_id":361,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Feb 03 16:07:59 EET 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Feb 03 16:07:59 EET 1999","text":"Setting all current Open/Normal to M4.","id":918,"bug_id":361,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Mar 06 07:08:59 EET 1999","creator":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Sat Mar 06 07:08:59 EET 1999","text":"per leger, assigning QA contacts to all open bugs without QA contacts according to list at http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Browser","id":919,"bug_id":361,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Apr 24 23:21:40 EEST 2000","creator":"shrir@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"shrir@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Mon Apr 24 23:21:40 EEST 2000","text":"sorry for the spam, changing QA contact.","id":272608,"bug_id":361,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Apr 25 15:50:23 EEST 2000","creator":"elig@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"elig@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Apr 25 15:50:23 EEST 2000","text":"PICS is not scheduled for inclusion in Seamonkey.
