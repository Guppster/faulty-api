I have a fix in hand, and it's checked into the javascript sources in js/ref (from which js/src is generated; see READMEs in js/ref and js/src.)  The fix is to change JSDOUBLE_IS_INT(d, i) to conditionalize the (jsint) cast on d being non-NaN, plus some removed casts and restructuring.  I'm putting off propagating it into js/src for the time being, because the client is currently in a stability freeze for the time being, and it's not a critical fix.  I'll close this bug as soon as I can propagate the fixes to js/src, and confirm that they correct the crash.","id":1311,"bug_id":476,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Sep 23 08:52:59 EEST 1998","creator":"mike+mozilla@meer.net","author":"mike+mozilla@meer.net","time":"Wed Sep 23 08:52:59 EEST 1998","text":"I propagated the fix, and Torsten Rüger just confirmed it for me on Alpha Linux.
