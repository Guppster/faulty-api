Hitting a keyboard key will not give ordinary Windows functionality, i.e. hitting a 'r' will scroll to the beginning of the r's in the list, etc. This is VERY unfortunate! (In your VM?) Updated by Garrett Arch Blythe (blythe@netscape.com) on Tuesday, July 21, 1998 2:52:47 PM PDT Additional Details : Dan, this is possibly a forms bug though the \"correct\" behavior is never specified in the report other than \"be like NS version 3.0\".  Rick may impossibly be talking about some 4.X Java AWT problem (the mention of a VM makes me think this).  More info may be needed, so Rick please be more specific if you are listening in.   Terry, I'm actually assigning to you.  I can't seem to assign bugs to danm@netscape.com who needs to handle this.","id":1327,"bug_id":488,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Aug 27 17:53:59 EEST 1998","creator":"terry@mozilla.org","author":"terry@mozilla.org","time":"Thu Aug 27 17:53:59 EEST 1998","text":"I have rudely created an account for danm, and am now reassigning this bug to him.","id":1328,"bug_id":488,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Sep 09 23:37:59 EEST 1998","creator":"danm.moz@gmail.com","author":"danm.moz@gmail.com","time":"Wed Sep 09 23:37:59 EEST 1998","text":"I can't reproduce this.  I tried the combobox on Amazon's front page, and listboxes on Bugsplat's query form.  All work as expected, or at least, they do the same thing in Mozilla as in Navigator.   Rick wasn't talking about something Java, was he?  Have I been asleep too long, or is that not yet a concern for Mozilla?  It would be most helpful if he could provide us with a public URL that demonstrates the problem.","id":1329,"bug_id":488,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Mar 04 20:38:59 EET 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Thu Mar 04 20:38:59 EET 1999","text":"Marking Verified/WorksForMe.","id":1330,"bug_id":488,"tags":[]}]}
