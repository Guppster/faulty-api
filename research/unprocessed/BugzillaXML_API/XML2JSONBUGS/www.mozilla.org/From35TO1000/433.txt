If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.  NETSCAPE caused an invalid page fault in module KERNEL32.DLL at 0137:bff780f4.\"  The version of Netscape being used is Navigator Gold 3.01. Updated by Patrick Pollet (Patrick.pollet@insa-lyon.fr) on Thursday, July 2, 1998 9:51:11 AM PDT Additional Details : Hi,   Never had it with Netscape 3.01 Gold. BUT    I am getting a similar problem with communicator 4.05 Fr and the new release (4.05 english with JDK 1.1 support).    Communicator is installed in a Netware file server and is launched by Netware Application Launcher . Makes no difference actually. I get the same when double-clicking on the EXE file.    This GPF happens BEFORE the splash screen shows up. Thus it is not a problem of cache or bad netscape.hst or bad user prefs as I have red in NUGIES.    If I just ignore the Windows dialog Box , Communicator DO load and run properly. I can then close the GPF dialog box,after Communictaor is fully loaded, and it keeps running ... and is functionnal...    It looks like a GPF in a \"side thread\" launched at startup. I did try to use a lower screen resolution (down to 640*349 * 16 colors) since I initially though it was a problem with the video drivers (S2 trio V3), but no difference.    This error only happens the first time a user launch Communicator after logging in. The second run is OK... but if we stops the PC or simply logout-login, we get the very same GPF at the first run !!!   It tried Dr Watson, but I never got any message. I tried to launch a DLL spy program, but I never found any extra DLL in memory whether I got or not the GPF...    I noticed that the mouse cursor always stays as \"hour glass\" ,until I press the mouse button, whether I get or not the GPF.     If I simply copy the Communicator directory on the local disk (or install it there), I never get the problem...     Looks like Windows is \" getting impatient\" about Communicator showing up and try to kill it ... why ?    Here is what I get on a 16Mb RAM PC ( win 95B, with kernel update and service pack 1). Never had any problem on machines with 32 Mb of RAM , whatever Windows version we are using...  NETSCAPE a causé une exception c0000006H dans le module KERNEL32.DLL à 0137:bff95db6.
