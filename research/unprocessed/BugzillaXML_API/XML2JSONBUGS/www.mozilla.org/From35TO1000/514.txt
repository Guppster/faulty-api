Additional problem appears after scrolling - click on right scroll bar to scroll up.  EXPECTED - scrolling are to clear and repaint with nes data ACTUAL - clearing does not occur and new data is superimposed on existing data. Sometimes ackground will appear black, the same color as the foreground text thereby obscuring it.  Got www.pcweek.com - similar problems occur  NOTE: By selecting \"Always use my colors, overriding document\" in the Color Preference menu, the web pages with display and scroll correctly.
