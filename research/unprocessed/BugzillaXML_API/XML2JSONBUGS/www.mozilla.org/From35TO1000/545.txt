When this bug was originally created, we didn't have the HTML forms for adding  and removing products with associated version numbers.  2) letting individual users control which version they report a bug  against scares the living daylights out of me. there's too much room for a user  to make an error. this way it forces the user to look for a valid version number  and if not, use other. all unaccounted for bugs with unaccounted versions drops  into the 'other' bucket, instead of the various other buckets of 'i can't type',  'i couldn't find my version number, so i'm going to create a random one', or my  favorite 'i'm going to recreate version 1.0 even through it's staring me right  in the face'.
