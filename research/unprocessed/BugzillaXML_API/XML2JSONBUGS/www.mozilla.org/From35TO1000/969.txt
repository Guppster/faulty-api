I'm changing the title appropriately.  First, you're not handling the min/max conflict resolution as described in http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visudet.html (CSS2, section 10.4 and 10.7)    If the computed value of 'min-width' is greater than the value of 'max-   width', 'max-width' is set to the value of 'min-width'.    (you're doing it backwards)  Second, if max-width is greater than width, you're setting width to max-width. Same for min-width.  (That is, you're enforcing the constraint as if it were on both sides!!!)  The bugs for max/min-height are exactly the same.
