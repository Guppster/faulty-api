I built Mozilla.exe and it works great except when I use the scroll bar or hit page down. I will try to build DEBUG and find the bug.  matt Updated by Matthew Stevens (mstevens@naviant.com) on Tuesday, April 14, 1998 8:15:35 AM PDT Additional Details : I have rebuilt the baseline with MOZ_DEBUG=1 and I DO NOT experience the problem anymore.  I will continue to use and test with the DEBUG version for now and move to the release build later,","id":377,"bug_id":201,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Mar 04 17:21:59 EET 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Thu Mar 04 17:21:59 EET 1999","text":"Marking Verified/Invalid.","id":378,"bug_id":201,"tags":[]}]}
