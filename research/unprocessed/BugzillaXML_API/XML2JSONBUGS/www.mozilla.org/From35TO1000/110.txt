(The X selection is unchanged.)  This works fine in 4.05. Updated by Steve Lamm (slamm@netscape.com) on Thursday, April 30, 1998 10:33:46 AM PDT Additional Details : My current version doesn't even give the \"Copy link location\" option when clicking on a link.  I will look into this. Note that the X selection should remain unchanged.  The \"Copy link locaiton\" command should copy the link into the copy buffer.
