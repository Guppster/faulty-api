We'll need to look at the actual javascript to understand what's going on. The source page has a table with 3 rows plus 1 script after the last row.  Each row has 1 cell.  The content of the 1st row is text.  The content of the 2nd row is generated from a script, it seems to be a FLASH data type.  The 3rd row contains an image.  There seems to be a 4th row generated by the script that resolves to an image also. In Nav 4.5b2 and IE 4.0, I see the first 3 rows:  text, FLASH plugin, image. In NGLayout, I see the 1st and 3rd rows, and the content of what should be the 4th row as content outside the table. A dump of the content shows a table with 3 rows with the script-generated 2nd row empty (<tr><\/tr>), and an image after the table.","id":3177,"bug_id":831,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Feb 03 16:08:59 EET 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Feb 03 16:08:59 EET 1999","text":"Setting all current Open/Normal to M4.","id":3178,"bug_id":831,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Mar 06 06:38:59 EET 1999","creator":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Sat Mar 06 06:38:59 EET 1999","text":"per leger, assigning QA contacts to all open bugs without QA contacts according to list at http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Browser","id":3179,"bug_id":831,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Apr 07 05:31:59 EEST 1999","creator":"vidur@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"vidur@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Apr 07 05:31:59 EEST 1999","text":"Maybe they changed the content, maybe we just got better.
