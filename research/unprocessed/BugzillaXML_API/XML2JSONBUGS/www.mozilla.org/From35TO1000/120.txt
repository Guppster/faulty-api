The crash is - Access Violation, using a pointer without checking if it is not NULL. The same thing happens if using OLE to register external viewer. The reason of the crash is a new piece of code in ns\\cmd\\winfe\\cxsave.cpp in CSaveCX::CanCreate() method:  //  If this file exists, then we must attempt another temp file. if(-1 != _access(pLocalName, 0))    {  int type = NET_URL_Type(pUrl->address); // bug 63751 for Mail/News attachment  pUrl here is NULL, so simple change fixes the cresh:  //  If this file exists, then we must attempt another temp file. if(-1 != _access(pLocalName, 0))    {    if(pUrl)    {       int type = NET_URL_Type(pUrl->address);       // bug 63751 for Mail/News attachment       ...    } Updated by Garrett Arch Blythe (blythe@netscape.com) on Monday, August 10, 1998 3:14:06 PM PDT Additional Details : Don't know who bugzilla@mozilla.org would be, or why they would desire to fix the bug.  Taking the bug over as clearly a windows issue.
