Version  \"%s - 5009808600\" (Looks like something may be wrong there).  I am using a Pentium Pro 200 with 64 Megs of ram (A micron system), my OS is NT 4.0 SP3 and IE4.  I was trying to read the news at www.slashdot.org, and I recieved an Application Error.  The contents of the box were :   \"The exception Breakpoint (Doah!)    A breakpoint has been reached.    (0x80000003)occurred in the application at location 0x77f76148.     Click on OK to ...    Click on CANCEL to ...\"  It appears as if someone left a breakpoint in the code, and needs to clear it...  Also when I overlap mozilla onto another window, such as wordpad, then change focus to wordpad, I have a chunk of mozilla stuck on the wordpad window...  And when I click on the \"Email me a password\" button without putting a name into the username section on the Bugzilla login screen, Mozilla asks if it wants me to remember the username and password, I click ok, and I get:   \"Debug Assertion Failed!
