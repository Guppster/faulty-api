Nav4 and IE treat row backgrounds as being inherited by the cells. The visual difference is the space between cells gets the table background rather than the row background. CSS-2 seems to indicate we should do it the way we're doing it today. I've added code to do this the Nav4 way, making sample 3 look correct. We can easily add variant code to check which mode we're in and do the correct thing.","id":1961,"bug_id":618,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Sep 27 19:54:59 EEST 2000","creator":"bugzilla@blakeross.com","author":"bugzilla@blakeross.com","time":"Wed Sep 27 19:54:59 EEST 2000","text":"reopening to fix RESOLUTION and marking verified.","id":450727,"bug_id":618,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Sep 27 19:55:31 EEST 2000","creator":"bugzilla@blakeross.com","author":"bugzilla@blakeross.com","time":"Wed Sep 27 19:55:31 EEST 2000","text":"fixed..","id":450729,"bug_id":618,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Sep 27 19:58:12 EEST 2000","creator":"bugzilla@blakeross.com","author":"bugzilla@blakeross.com","time":"Wed Sep 27 19:58:12 EEST 2000","text":"vrfy fixed","id":450737,"bug_id":618,"tags":[]}]}
