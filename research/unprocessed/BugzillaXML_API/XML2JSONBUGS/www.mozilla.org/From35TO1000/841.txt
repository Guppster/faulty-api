I am running MacOS 8.1 on a PowerMac G3/300 with 128MB of RAM.  I launched Mozilla and was successfully playing around with it when I tried to change the visited link color (to red) in the prefs dialog.  Shortly after I hit the OK button, it crashed with a Type 3 error.  After that, running the same user configuration caused Mozilla to crash while starting up.  I was able to create a new user, and tried changing the visited link color again--it crashed again.  I tried downloading a fresh copy of Mozilla, and the same thing occurred.  In short, this bug seems very repeatable.  Cordially, Steven G.
