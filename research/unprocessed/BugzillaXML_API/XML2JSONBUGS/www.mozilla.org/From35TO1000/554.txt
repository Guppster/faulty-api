Here is some brainstorming:  I think \"show recent activity\" would be most useful in combination with bug 72132 (\"[RFE] Daily/Weekly digests.\"), or even together with offering a \"pull\" model for notifications. (Is there a bug on the latter yet?)  I have bookmarked a stored query that asks for all bugs in the Bugzilla product where someone added a comment after some date. Every day or two, I used to load this bookmark, change the date to the one from my last buglist, then run it. Then I write down the date from the new buglist manually, and read through the bugs. There are several problems: - As soon as I do another bugzilla query, the \"current buglist remembered by bugzilla\" gets overwritten, and the \"Next\" link on the bug I'm working on disappears.  - When reading the bugs on the list, I have to manually find the first comment that is new. Both of these could be solved or worked around by displaying the \"recent activity\" for each bug on the buglist itself: The information on such a page would be self-contained, so it wouldn't matter much if the \"current buglist\" gets overwritten, and only the recent comments are displayed (together with the non-comment-activity), so no need to search for anything. The downside of this approach is that it doesn't scale particularly well: If the number of bugs or the time interval is too large, then the result will be a _huge_ page, and the browser probably won't be able to handle it (or crash with an out-of-memory error).
