Mac and WinNT ignore the OPTGROUP tag in a safe way and just render the options in the dropdown as if they were listed directly under select. Linux Viewer was very strange. Maybe this is known behavior since I haven't used Linux Viewer ever since there was an apprunner.

From a UI perspective, I would indeed expect similar behavior to, say, submenus in menus in a standard Windows application. For example:  Click once to drop down the OPTGROUP. You should see:  China   > India   > Japan   >  And after the cursor hovers over India, you should see:  China   > India   >|  Assam      | China   >|  Darjeeling |  That is, ideally you would see something that resembles a submenu.  As it currently stands, what you get isn't really anything like what I've described above. Although it works OK for me, I definitely forsee usability problems, especially in that things appear in the OPTGROUP now that are not selectable. For example, if you load the attached test case into the 20-Aug-99 build under Win32, you get a long list of things in different fonts. Some are selectable, and some aren't; this may be confusing (or even infuriating) to anyone not familiar with the concept of the OPTGROUP.

Since this is open source, I say go for it and  implement it.   :)  We have always kept in the back our minds that we would eventually have to  support nested optgroupd deeper then one level. At this time I don't think the  parser supports a deeper nesting.   Either in the next release or the one that follows, depending on time  constraints, we will use XBL controld for the form widgets and this will enable  us to have cascading menus.  When the spec actually changes then someone should file a new bug and assign it  to me. But right now, we implement optgroups per the spec.","id":526757,"bug_id":994,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Dec 05 17:08:32 EET 2000","creator":"netdragon@gmail.com","author":"netdragon@gmail.com","time":"Tue Dec 05 17:08:32 EET 2000","text":"Thats great, do the more important things first.
