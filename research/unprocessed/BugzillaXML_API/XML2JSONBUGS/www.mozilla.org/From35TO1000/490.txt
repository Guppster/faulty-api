(RETURN) How are you today? (RETURN)  generates ... <BODY> Hello World! <BR>How Are You Today <BR>&nbsp; ...  The Linefeed before the <BR> tag creates additional white space, which is anoying in several circumstances (eg. you set the font size of the line to size=-2, then the '\\n' produces a white space of size=0, which changes the line height). A better solution would be '<BR>\\n', since whitespace is removed after a <BR>.

As with any other source code, HTML should be formatted in a way that's readable by humans, not obfusticated by removing whitespace. I'm not terribly picky about how its formatted, but keeping lines under 80 characters (except for things like long urls) should be a goal. Humans should be able to edit the documents and be able to make test cases for bugzilla. \"cvs diff\" should be able to return something meaningful after a document is edited. (not some giant 900character long monstrosity).  There are several problems with accepting documents created with 4.x and I'd really like it if I could get composer users switched over to Mozilla but I can't do that until this is fixed.
