The expected result is that the spacing between cells be transparent.  Another example of rendering behavior is: http://webgroup/ - the top table should have a border down the center and along the bottom, but it doesn't. The bottom table, however, that has the who's who in it, does have the cell boarders display correctly.","id":4269,"bug_id":995,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Oct 10 06:15:59 EEST 1998","creator":"angus@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"angus@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Sat Oct 10 06:15:59 EEST 1998","text":"I spent some time playing with this testcase. The table has spacing between the cells. In Navigator 4 and 5, there is a bug where the space between cells is displayed as the color of the body (transparent), even when the author explicitly sets a BGCOLOR on the TABLE element that should be inherited by the cellspacing.  If you look at this page in a standards compliant browser like IE or NGLayout, it does what the spec says it should do -- let the space between cells inherit the color of the table background.  To achieve the effect of setting background color on certain cells, rows, or columns, but not on the space inbetween the cells, it's possible to use the BGCOLOR attribute in association with the other tags, like TR or TD.  Since this is a Gromit bug, I suggest reassinging to Nisheeth and changing the product identifier.","id":4270,"bug_id":995,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Oct 21 18:05:59 EEST 1998","creator":"rubydoo123@aol.com","author":"rubydoo123@aol.com","time":"Wed Oct 21 18:05:59 EEST 1998","text":"granted the cellspacing and border should inherit from the table element, we need to consider user expectation. Up to this time, the user expects to see the parent color within the cellspacing area not the table element color. But, I agree that the current nglayout rendering is the best way to go. I'm just concerned that our current user base will have issues until they are use to the new method of laying out the table.
