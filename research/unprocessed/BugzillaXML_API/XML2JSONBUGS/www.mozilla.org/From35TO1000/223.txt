The compilation aborts because the file ns/nsprpub/pr/src/misc/prnetdb.c contains a function declaration that conflicts with one of the predefined function in the kernel. It is the function getprotobynumber_r(PRInt32 number) which already exists and is used for 'reentrant' network use.  Here is the full error message, if this can help: gcc -o Linux2.1.91_x86_DBG.OBJ/prnetdb.o -c -g -fPIC -ansi -Wall -DLINUX -Dlinux -mno-486 -DLINUX1_2 -Di386 -D_POSIX_SOURCE -D_BSD_SOURCE -DHAVE_STRERROR -DFORCE_PR_LOG -DXP_UNIX -DDEBUG -UNDEBUG -DDEBUG_enlight -D_PR_LOCAL_THREADS_ONLY -I../../../../dist/Linux2.1.91_x86_DBG.OBJ/include/private -I../../../../dist/Linux2.1.91_x86_DBG.OBJ/include prnetdb.c prnetdb.c:383: conflicting types for `getprotobyname_r' /usr/include/netdb.h:330: previous declaration of `getprotobyname_r' prnetdb.c:388: conflicting types for `getprotobynumber_r' /usr/include/netdb.h:337: previous declaration of `getprotobynumber_r' Updated by Wan-Teh Chang (wtc@netscape.com) on Friday, April 24, 1998 12:59:47 PM PDT Additional Details : You can try one of the two fixes: 1. ns/nsprpub/config/Linux.mk: pretend that you are    on a 2.0.x system, i.e., add this         ifeq ($(basename $(OS_RELEASE)),2.0)         PLATFORM_FLAGS += -DLINUX2_0         endif  2. ns/nsprpub/pr/src/misc/prnetdb.c: change the 'LINUX2_0'    macro to 'LINUX'.  I think solution 2 alone should fix this problem.  But in the meantime, it's probably a good idea to define the LINUX2_0 macro on 2.1.x systems. Updated by Wan-Teh Chang (wtc@netscape.com) on Tuesday, June 16, 1998 8:30:53 PM PDT Additional Details : I checked in solution 2 (checking 'LINUX' instead of 'LINUX2_0' in prnetdb.c), so it should work now.  Closed the bug.  By the way, I had a typo in my previous message. Solution 1 should read:       ifeq ($(basename $(OS_RELEASE)),2.1)       PLATFORM_FLAGS += -DLINUX2_0       endif","id":427,"bug_id":223,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Apr 27 17:59:59 EEST 1999","creator":"terry@mozilla.org","author":"terry@mozilla.org","time":"Tue Apr 27 17:59:59 EEST 1999","text":"NSPR now has its own Bugzilla product.
