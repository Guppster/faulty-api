When I killed Raptor and refreshed Mozilla everything worked fine again.  The promised lack of interaction appears to be broken somehow.  I'm doing this on an HP Omnibook 800CT with a 7/1 version of Mozilla.  I also just noticed that the little titles under my desktop icons had the same problem when they got covered over by Raptor.  Perhaps it's not forwarding a message to invalidate screen areas after it gives them up?","id":1648,"bug_id":562,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Aug 28 01:22:59 EEST 1998","creator":"angus@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"angus@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Aug 28 01:22:59 EEST 1998","text":"This is not a Mozilla-specific issue. Your version of Raptor was leaking memory in a major way and hogging GDI resources. When you have no GDI resources, this is what happens. There was a known issue in that timeframe with GDI resource consumption having to do with Test 9. It has since been fixed (to the best of my knowledge) by Chris. Chris, can you mark this as fixed if it is indeed fixed?
