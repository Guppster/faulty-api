It's overdue in mozilla, in the competition, and demanded by champions and users.  When I or Chuck Simmons (chrlsim@futureone.com, netscape champion) or many others surf the wilds of the Internet, we turn JS off.  Why?  Paranoia, good sense, whatever -- it doesn't matter.  Mozilla has not had its last security hole closed.  This goes for JS, Java, HTML layout (remember the Danish form-type-change attack), netlib, etc.  Then there are denial of service attacks to consider.  OK, what can be done?  This bug (really, RFE) asks that mozilla at least automate the disabling of executable content when surfing away from URLs that begin with host parts from a known-trustworthy set of fully-qualified domain names.  That requires preference UI support, I suppose.  Although with just the pref checking code in libmocha and the Java glue, and with a signed script that called navigator.preference, we (or anyone trusted) could construct a \"set your shields-up preferences\" page on mozilla.org, home.netscape.com, that acted as a web-server-based pref UI.  So Mike, can you bug me about implementation, do the libmocha hacks (or find someone else to do them), then reassign this bug to raman for Java?  We should figure out the pref syntax and value types first, make them common and extensible.  After you and raman are done, we can give it to german for UI consideration -- but the web-based pref UI approach seems better to me.  /be","id":3316,"bug_id":858,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Sep 22 03:42:59 EEST 1998","creator":"dveditz@mozilla.com","author":"dveditz@mozilla.com","time":"Tue Sep 22 03:42:59 EEST 1998","text":"Don't forget mail.

We already have a javascript.allow.* pref namespace, that's where javascript.allow.mailnews lives.  I was proposing by phone to mlm (and therefore dots got lost) this idea:  Add a new pref object node, javascript.allow.domain.  Under it, users could create names like  javascript.allow.domain.mypal.sgi.com javascript.allow.domain.netscape.com javascript.allow.domain.mozilla.org  Add another new pref node, javascript.deny.domain, so that users can arrange for JS to be disabled elsewhere:  javascript.deny.domain.com // restrictive! javascript.deny.domain.sgi.com  and perhaps even  javascript.deny.domain[\"*\"]  for all.  Then modify LM_CanDoJS (http://cvs-mirror.mozilla.org/webtools/lxr/ident?i=LM_CanDoJS) after making sure it is used universally to decide whether JS is enabled to have this logic:      if (there is a pref of the form javascript.deny.domain.x where x is a         domain-name-suffix of the current URL's host part, or the same as the         current URL's host part) {         if (there is not a pref of the form javascript.allow.domain.y where y             is a longer domain-name-suffix of the current URL's host part) {             return JS_FALSE;         }     }     ... rest of LM_CanDoJS logic here  This is almost too easy.  There'll probably be hassles with LM_CanDoJS not being universally quantified.  There won't be any threading hassles cuz this function is used only in the mozilla thread.  There could be some sharing of domain suffix checking or extraction with the lm_doc.c DOC_DOMAIN property's code, but it's short enough to rip off.  After this is done, the UI could be done entirely by a signed script, say on Netscape's home page (signed by Netscape's SSL cert so it's already trusted, for better or worse).  /be","id":3319,"bug_id":858,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Sep 24 14:10:59 EEST 1998","creator":"dveditz@mozilla.com","author":"dveditz@mozilla.com","time":"Thu Sep 24 14:10:59 EEST 1998","text":"How would this proposal deal with JavaScript in mail?
