Updated by Steve Lamm (slamm@netscape.com) on Friday, May 8, 1998 5:31:25 PM PDT Additional Details : I need to fix this.  It happens because Aurora is only set up to read in your bookmarks at the beginning.  From there on out, you should edit your bookmarks in Aurora and the old interface will go away.  We are not there yet, but I have changes in the works to make it happen.","id":482,"bug_id":241,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Sep 09 16:24:59 EEST 1998","creator":"slamm@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"slamm@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Sep 09 16:24:59 EEST 1998","text":"The old bookmark interface is dead now.
