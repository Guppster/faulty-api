The call to SECNAV_SSLCapabilities at line 2344 in winfe\\fegui.cpp expects a return value that is a malloc'ed string, such as would be returned from strdup().  Since the current SECNAV_SSLCapabilities at line 242 in navstubs.c returns NULL, this causes a crash at line 2346 in fegui.cpp.  To fix this, alter the return statement in SECNAV_SSLCapabilities to be ``return(strdup(\"\"));''","id":969,"bug_id":389,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Feb 03 16:07:59 EET 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Feb 03 16:07:59 EET 1999","text":"Setting all current Open/Normal to M4.","id":970,"bug_id":389,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Mar 01 09:43:59 EET 1999","creator":"jsw@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"jsw@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Mon Mar 01 09:43:59 EET 1999","text":"This should be assigned to a windows FE engineer.
