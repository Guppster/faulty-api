The patch has been posted to the mozilla.patches or mozilla.builds newsgroup.  I need more testing before I check in the patch, but until then you can edit mozilla/nsprpub/pr/include/md/_linux.h and change     #undef _PR_POLL_AVAILABLE to     #if defined(__GLIBC__) && __GLIBC__ >= 2     #define _PR_POLL_AVAILABLE     #endif  Sorry for the inconvenience.  This will be fixed by Sept. 30.  The reason I haven't checked it in is that the NSPR v3.0 beta landing was not as smooth as I hoped, and to open the tree (so that the poor release engineers can go home) I had to make all the Tinderbox continuous builds work. So under the time pressure I had to check in something that just fix the non-pthreads (the default) build breakage, at the cost of breaking the pthreads build (which I actually noticed right away but did not want to check in another hasty fix).","id":3709,"bug_id":919,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Oct 01 08:44:59 EEST 1998","creator":"wtc@google.com","author":"wtc@google.com","time":"Thu Oct 01 08:44:59 EEST 1998","text":"The fix I described earlier has been checked in.","id":3710,"bug_id":919,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Feb 05 18:07:59 EET 1999","creator":"glynn@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"glynn@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Feb 05 18:07:59 EET 1999","text":"qa contact set to reporter for verify","id":3711,"bug_id":919,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Apr 27 18:00:59 EEST 1999","creator":"terry@mozilla.org","author":"terry@mozilla.org","time":"Tue Apr 27 18:00:59 EEST 1999","text":"NSPR now has its own Bugzilla product.
