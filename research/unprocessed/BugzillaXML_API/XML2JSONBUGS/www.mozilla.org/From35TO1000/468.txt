It doesn't seem to show up in 4.05.  Thanks for the report! Updated by Mike McCabe (mccabe@netscape.com) on Tuesday, July 7, 1998 3:49:23 PM PDT Additional Details : mlm has confirmed that the bug doesn't show up in 4.06 either, and javascript/libmocha changes from 4.06 are being migrated to Mozilla as soon as we have a stability thaw, so it seems likely that this problem my go away with those changes.  Until then, I'll keep an eye on it.","id":1267,"bug_id":468,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Sep 14 20:37:59 EEST 1998","creator":"mike+mozilla@meer.net","author":"mike+mozilla@meer.net","time":"Mon Sep 14 20:37:59 EEST 1998","text":"Mass move of libmocha-related bugs to libmocha owner.
