Resizing the main browser window causes and endless loop of trying to refresh the screen.  This has been compiled on RedHat Linux 5.1 with Motif 2.1.  A stack trace reveals a stack that has over 500 stack frames in less than a second.  This was generated by pausing the browser in gdb, resizing the window and then restarting the browser and immediately stopping it again.  Letting it run for over 2 seconds created a stack that had over 2000 frames.  The stack trace for anyone who is interested is located at:  http://odin.appliedtheory.com/big_stack_trace.txt  It's a bit large to attach to a bug report. Updated by Christopher Blizzard (blizzard@appliedtheory.com) on Thursday, August 13, 1998 8:37:18 AM PDT Additional Details : I have verified that this bug has shown up in between the mozilla-19980603 and the mozilla-19980728 releases and affects the version that is in CVS now.  I've built all three on the same machine.  Version 06/03 works well and verions 07/28 exhibits the problem.  I'll spend more time on it when I get home tonight and see if I can track it down.","id":1456,"bug_id":524,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Sep 29 07:39:59 EEST 1998","creator":"mcafee@gmail.com","author":"mcafee@gmail.com","time":"Tue Sep 29 07:39:59 EEST 1998","text":"We've had lots of problems with Motif 2.x, have you tried compiling with 1.2.x?","id":1457,"bug_id":524,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Sep 29 13:34:59 EEST 1998","creator":"blizzard@mozilla.com","author":"blizzard@mozilla.com","time":"Tue Sep 29 13:34:59 EEST 1998","text":"This problem has fixed itself in more recent revisions of xfe.
