Curiously enough, the font smoothing occurs even with font-smoothing turned off in the display properies! Is that now a feature of NGLayout?  Every build of NGLayout has had the exact same problem.  Every &nbsp; renders with a black dot, sort of like the dot that can accompany a list item (but smaller). When there are many &nbsp; in a row, they run flush against one another. I had assumed that the &nbsp; was being represented by a dot for layout testing purposes (to see how much space it was taking).  I guess I was wrong! :)  This bug is still following me into the 9-10-98 build of NGLayout. At http://www5.localweb.com/fingerstyle/mozillaZine/ I see a little black dot on the orange field directly beside the smokestack. An &nbsp; is in that <TD><\/TD>. A black dot also appears beside the title of each news item (directly to the left, where I had placed an &nbsp;. Finally, One appears in the deep red field of the title of each news item, to the right of the date.  Since there are no font controls in the NGLayout viewer, I can't set to a different font to see if that's the issue.  Basically, all of the fonts are rendering as I expect, so you may want to try installing Verdana and Georgia on your machine. They're TrueType fonts available from the evil empire at: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/default.htm  If you look at Demo #9 in the NGLayout viewer package, in the top frame I see a string of &nbsp; between the words \"Frame 1\" and \"Frame 2\" that head the two inline frames.  The chain is broken in 3 places.  That's the best I can do to describe it for the moment.  --chris","id":2568,"bug_id":729,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Sep 11 16:20:59 EEST 1998","creator":"kipp@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"kipp@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Sep 11 16:20:59 EEST 1998","text":"I did some testings on a win95 machine (it's OSR2 at least) and still could not see the problem.
