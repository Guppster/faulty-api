Back with Netscape Gold the positioning was three seperate buttons.  When Communicator came out they integrated it into one list button.

I wouldn't characterize the results as a success (not that it was a failure either). The recommendation was to separate it back into three buttons.  We're not going to be able to explain to each user why it's a popup/combobox widget rather than 3 buttons (which every other app uses).  We really shouldn't reimplement this in a popup/combobox; it should be more consistent with other apps that allow users to manipulate alignment.  My recommendation:  We should be sure that the default UI for Ender 5.0 has alignment split into 3 buttons (or we should remove alignment from the toolbar altogether).","id":2928,"bug_id":794,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Dec 18 16:53:59 EET 1998","creator":"brade@comcast.net","author":"brade@comcast.net","time":"Fri Dec 18 16:53:59 EET 1998","text":"change product to NGLayout","id":2929,"bug_id":794,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Mar 06 06:08:59 EET 1999","creator":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Sat Mar 06 06:08:59 EET 1999","text":"per leger, assigning QA contacts to all open bugs without QA contacts according to list at http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Browser","id":2930,"bug_id":794,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Mar 17 15:56:59 EET 1999","creator":"kostello@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"kostello@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Mar 17 15:56:59 EET 1999","text":"Akkana, this is a feature request.
