I get compiler messages \"Initializer element not constant\" with           stdin/stdout/stderr. Why?    {RM,AJ} Constructs like:   static FILE *InPtr = stdin;    lead to this message.  This is correct behaviour with glibc since stdin is   not a constant expression.  Please note that a strict reading of ISO C does   not allow above constructs.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Since the variable real_stderr gets initialized in cmd/xfe/mozilla.c:main and in cmd/xfe/src/context_funcs.cpp, there is no point in setting its value here.
