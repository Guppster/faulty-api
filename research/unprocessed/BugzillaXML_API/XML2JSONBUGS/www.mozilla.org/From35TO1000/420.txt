The background color of that widget depends on the default background of the GUI environment and is not set based on the color specified in the HTML.  Thats why you see this bug in both Navigator and IE.  The HTML 4.0 spec doesn't specify how the background of the SELECT tag should be rendered.  And the CSS spec is pretty vague about how CSS style rules should get applied to form elements.  This is a topic that will be discussed at the upcoming CSS working group meeting.  So, currently, it is unclear whether this behavior is really a bug or not.  I'll update this bug with more status after the CSS working group resolves this \"CSS-style-on-forms\" issue.","id":1015,"bug_id":420,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Apr 14 03:24:59 EEST 1999","creator":"nisheeth_mozilla@yahoo.com","author":"nisheeth_mozilla@yahoo.com","time":"Wed Apr 14 03:24:59 EEST 1999","text":"Peter, you must have more information on this bug.

Consider it equivalent to: select { background: Menu; } or select { backgroun: Window; } in the UA style sheet.

However, when the list is dropped down, the background of the list is white, not yellow.  MSIE 5.0 draws the list background as yellow.  On Linux, the box appears blue not yellow, because the box is cropped in so tightly to the blue 'selected' text area.  Also, when the list drops down, the box remains blue, unlike Windows.  It's as though the box never looses focus to the list.  Finally, the colors on Linux are different, in the dropdown list on Windows, it's black text on a white background and the selection is white text on a blue background.  On Linux though, it's black text on a gray background and the selection is black text on a white background.  I didn't test Mac.  Kevin, when you get this bug fixed, can you set it to M15 and reassign it to me as a bookmark that native widgets are still broken?

The display area for the combo box is explicitly set to white in the ua.css, but the dropdown inherits the style set for the select so it is the pale yellow specified in the test case. To support the display area as yellow we would need to set the background-color to inherit, but that currently conflicts with the XPFE toolkit look and feel.  Eric, I'm re-assinging to you and marking it [NATIVE-WIDGET] to indicate it's a native widget issue.","id":1022,"bug_id":420,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Dec 17 04:27:59 EET 1999","creator":"pollmann@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"pollmann@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Dec 17 04:27:59 EET 1999","text":"We're not using native widgets anymore.
