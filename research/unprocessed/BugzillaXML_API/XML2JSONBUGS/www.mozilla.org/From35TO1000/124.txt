We need to fix the space skipping mechanism  * to remove this case (we can go into an infinite loop here if there''s not enough space  * for the first word).  *  * Should be able to have a new flag \"canSkipSpace\" but then actually don''t skip it. Then  * if the line does fit and it''s at the beginning, we can skip the space. lo_FindLineBreak  * should probably be the one to do this work so that the width we get back is correct.  */  This text appears in LO_Layout_Text_Block() of lib\\layout\\leytext.c, 6486 lines into it to be exact. A quick way to skip it for stable build is to quote out the \"continue\" statement at the end of the function, altough this will cause at the very least bad formattign and potential loss of readability/text in the browser. However, for debugging and testing etc. I find this more desirable than an all-out crash while waiting for a correct patch, which I assume by the remark in the source-code Netscape is working on if hasn''t already finished.  To actually see this bug in action (Well, as much as there''s to see in a hanging up browser) try the page http://www.cnet.com/Content/Builder/Authoring/Xml20/ss04.htm l - warning, make sure you have nothing important unsaved/in process in Mozilla, because there''s no graceful way out of this.

So nobody at Netscape was dealing with this problem.  Am assigning this bug to myself...
