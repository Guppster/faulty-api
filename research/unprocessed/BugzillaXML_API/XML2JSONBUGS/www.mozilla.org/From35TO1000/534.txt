Admin must then go in & reset directory permissions for the affected users.  This appears to occur with NIS and local users, NFS and local home directories.  This \"feature\" has been around since at lest Navigator 4.02.  Under Linux, the same process will save the bookmarks in a file called -0nnnnn in the specified directory, where nnnnn is the PID of the mozilla/netscape process.  This appears to be the \"correct\" behavior in this case.","id":1508,"bug_id":534,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Oct 03 20:37:59 EEST 1998","creator":"atotic@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"atotic@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Sat Oct 03 20:37:59 EEST 1998","text":"You are working on XP_File now?","id":1509,"bug_id":534,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Oct 14 18:29:59 EEST 1998","creator":"toshok@gmail.com","author":"toshok@gmail.com","time":"Wed Oct 14 18:29:59 EEST 1998","text":"toshok@netscape.com => toshok@hungry.com","id":1510,"bug_id":534,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Feb 26 02:26:59 EET 1999","creator":"var@sgi.com","author":"var@sgi.com","time":"Fri Feb 26 02:26:59 EET 1999","text":"This bug was fixed in the 4.51 release so should be able to get closed unless the bug fix didn't get into the Mozilla codebase.
