Please point out anything I've overlooked.  From the web page linked above, the main aspect of the problem is summarized this way:  \"After a client sends PORT, an attacker can connect to the client's TCP port before the server does.\"  I don't see how that could happen... since it's TCP, the attacker can't simply send a small malicious file in a single packet and the victim won't fully establish a TCP connection with the attacker (unless the attacker has assumed the IP of the ftp server and is blocking the ftp server's traffic to the victim in which case the attacker can do anything they could do anything they want even without the victim using PORT).  Provided Moz is smart enough to only accept connections that originate from the same IP that the PORT command was sent to, we should be safe from that part, right?  Next point they make: \"Connection Laundering\".  This would seem to be pretty close to impossible to pull off.  The first hinderance is that the ftp server has to allow PORTs to a 3rd party (don't most disable that now?).  What really makes this hard is that the attacker has to see the victim's PORT, and somehow send a PORT to the same ftp server and get it to reply to the victim using the attacker's PORT command *before* it processes the reply to the victim's own PORT command (which had a head start).  Granted that under heavy network load and high CPU usage, it's within the realm of possibility, but it's based on an unlikely roll of chance under unusualy circumstances on a poorly configured server.  The third thing the mention is the case where the attacker and victim are on the same multi-user system.  I don't see how this makes it any easier for the attacker unless the attacker is root.  If the attacker is root (rightfully or otherwise), the victim won't be protected by running a PASV ftp client.  If there's something that I've overlooked that does present a real security concern, please point it out so I can revise my thinking.  Having said all that, I have no personal interest in active ftp, passive works just fine for me. :)","id":1646588,"bug_id":465,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Dec 13 01:16:43 EET 2002","creator":"bugzilla@mversen.de","author":"bugzilla@mversen.de","time":"Fri Dec 13 01:16:43 EET 2002","text":"*** Bug 185125 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***","id":1675562,"bug_id":465,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Mar 14 01:57:27 EET 2003","creator":"benc@meer.net","author":"benc@meer.net","time":"Fri Mar 14 01:57:27 EET 2003","text":"I found one site that rejects PASV, and it looks like for recent builds, we hang open and do not error.
