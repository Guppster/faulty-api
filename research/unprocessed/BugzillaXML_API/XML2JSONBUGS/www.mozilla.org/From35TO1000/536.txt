Surely a local copy of this should be used and perhaps update this local copy when you're next connected to the Net \"live\" (assuming you can tell if you're online vs. offline), so that when you're next offline, it'll have an up-to-date local copy of the RDF file to use.","id":1521,"bug_id":536,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Jan 04 22:38:59 EET 1999","creator":"don@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"don@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Mon Jan 04 22:38:59 EET 1999","text":"Re-assign to rjc@netscape.com.
