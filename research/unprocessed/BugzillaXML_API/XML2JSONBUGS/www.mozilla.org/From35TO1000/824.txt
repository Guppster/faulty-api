The *bad* reason is because, when that code was originally written, I hadn't quite figured out all the quoting rules for all the various places that the password was getting thrown around.  And rather than work hard and get the quoting rules right, I was lazy and restricted it to things that were easy to quote.  But I'm now much more on top of the way quoting needs to be done, and the world has changed in other interesting ways too, and it's time to relax these restrictions.","id":3135,"bug_id":824,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Oct 06 21:48:59 EEST 1998","creator":"terry@mozilla.org","author":"terry@mozilla.org","time":"Tue Oct 06 21:48:59 EEST 1998","text":"The database is being reorganized a bit.
