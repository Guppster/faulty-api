This font consists of sheet music symbols, like treble cleff, half note, etc. etc.  In the font preferences page, there are a pair of list boxes showing the different fonts as they actually appear.  For some reason, SPW is listed as a font, and it appears to be forcing a resize of these controls.  Both listboxes are increased height-wise, and this causes the top font listbox to slightly overlap the lower font listbox.  It would look better if the spacing between the two listboxes was doubled, of if a better filter mechanism could be found to weed symbolic fonts out of the listing.","id":3558,"bug_id":900,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Nov 11 00:08:59 EET 1998","creator":"danm.moz@gmail.com","author":"danm.moz@gmail.com","time":"Wed Nov 11 00:08:59 EET 1998","text":"An interesting problem, but it involves the \"classic\" Mozilla codebase.  We're in the throes of completely replacing the \"classic\" UI code with all new, completely different stuff.  You (Bryce) might want to keep an eye on the problem and let us know if it reappears in the new UI code when that's available.
