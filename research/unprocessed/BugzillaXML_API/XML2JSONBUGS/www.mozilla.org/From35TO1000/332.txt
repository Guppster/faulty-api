So right now it just prints out that it fell through teh switch at that file & line number. Maybe there should be an assertion saying someone called the function with the wrong parameters, if these are wrong. Have someone who understands that file check this and do something intelligent.  Got rid of some unused variables as well.  [patch submitted to newsgroup].
