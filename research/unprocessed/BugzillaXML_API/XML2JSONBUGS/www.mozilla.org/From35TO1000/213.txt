I mean code seems fine. Since Its a .java file I cant test it right now. I've to do it when I install JDK or Semantec or J++. I'll do that soon. But the only thing I'm concerned is destination. Here is some description how destination exactly works here.  _self: only works if applet is showing. _parent: for parent window. don't specify: browser's choice. _top: the Frame that contains applet. _blank: a new, unnamed window. My Window: a window named \"My Window\".  So I think you could try, _blank or creating your own window.
