After watching the NT Task Manager, we have found that the process netscape.exe keeps requesting memory until about 12000K at which point Netscape crashes ( using 32 MB of RAM.) Numerous messages occur with the lack of Virutal Memory.     We are looking for a confirmation on this finding. I already looked at developer.netscape.com and home.netscape.com without finding any whitepapers on the topic.

Mozilla has a great many memory leaks; the picture changes from day to day.  At one point, I had it down to 10 at startup.  Today, it has 39 for about 400 bytes.  Loading Netscape Netcenter leaks about 20 times again.  We shoot some down occasionally; someone makes some more.  It's a thing in flux.   There are other pages which can eat huge, gaping chunks of memory legitimately.  Opening multiple pages and printing can also use a lot of the stuff.   If you (dthable) suspect a couple of particular websites as showcasing Mozilla memory leaks particularly dramatically, please add the URL(s) to this report, and re-open the bug.  I'm interested in quashing any egregious memory leaks we may have right now.  But I don't know of any that stand out above the noise or pose any serious immediate threat.  In general, the poor thing is known to suffer from a bunch of small leaks which aren't known to cause any serious harm. We fix them occasionally.","id":652,"bug_id":284,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Feb 26 23:09:59 EET 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Feb 26 23:09:59 EET 1999","text":"Try the latest mozilla code.
