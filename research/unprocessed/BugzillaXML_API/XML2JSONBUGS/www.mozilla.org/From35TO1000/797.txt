JavaSoft needs this sometime before Sept 1 in order to put together a beta for us.  I think this means making <object classid=clsid:...> be able to specify a JVM (I think this is what they do for IE).  We may also want to add some kind of version information so that users can say \"I want to run in any jvm that supports 1.2 or greater\", e.g.:  <object type=\"application/x-java-vm;version=1.2;mfg=JavaSoft\" ...>  (extensions to the type attribute), or additional attributes:  <object type=application/x-java-vm  version=1.2 mfg=JavaSoft>   ------- Additional Comments From warren  07/09/98 14:24 -------  Here's what they want...  Subject:            proposal for <OBJECT> tag in Navigator 5     Date:            Mon, 06 Jul 1998 13:37:51 -0700    From:            Graham Hamilton <kgh@zebadee>       To:            robsz@zebadee, stanleyh@zebadee       CC:            kgh@zebadee, dochez@zebadee    Here's a suggestion for what to propose to Netscape on the <OBJECT> tag. Comments appreciated.                                                               - Graham   Goals:     We'd like to have Navigator support the same form of <OBJECT> tag that    we use to invoke the Java Plug-in under IE.  This makes it easier for    developers to write portable HTML.  Here's a sample:          <OBJECT                 WIDTH=275 HEIGHT=30                 align=\"baseline\"                 border=\"0\"                 CLASSID=\"CLSID:8aAD9C840-044E-11D1-B3E9-00805F499D93\"                 codebase=\"http://javaweb.eng//jinstall-111-win32.cab#Version= 1,1,1,0\">                         <PARAM NAME=\"code\" VALUE=\"Clock2.class\">                         <PARAM NAME=\"FontFamily\" VALUE=\"Courier\">         <\/OBJECT>      We'd like to make it easy for Navigator to support.     We'd like to make it somewhat flexible, so that other peopple can also    use the same syntax with different CLSIDs.  Proposal:     When an <OBJECT> tag is encountered with a Microsft style CLASSID    (i.e. one where the value starts with \"CLSID:\") Navigator should simply    activate a plug-in, where:     (1) The Plugin's MIME type is the CLASSID value.  So the Java Plug-in        would support the MIME type CLSID:8AD9C840-044E-11D1-B3E9-00805F499D93     (2) Navigator would recognize and implement the WIDTH, HEIGHT, ALIGN, ID,        and BORDER parameters to the OBJECT tag in the normal way.     (3) All the tag=value pairs in the <OBJECT> tag and all the PARAM/VALUE        tags in the <OBJECT> body are passed as parameters to the plugin.     (4) Navigator would ignore the codebase parameter.  So you need to        have a suitable plugin already installed.  Rationale:     It's a little hokey, but it's reusing lot of existing mechanism.     This is very similar to how Navigator 4 already deals with <OBJECT> tags,    except we are using CLASSID rather than TYPE to obtain the MIME type.    So hopefully it should be easy to implement.     Because we simply use the CLASSID as the Mime type, it's easy for    us (and for others) to deliver plugins that work with specific    Microsoft COM object ids.","id":2950,"bug_id":797,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Feb 09 00:54:59 EET 1999","creator":"cmaximus@gmail.com","author":"cmaximus@gmail.com","time":"Tue Feb 09 00:54:59 EET 1999","text":"installing myself as QA Contact en masse","id":2951,"bug_id":797,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Mar 20 01:01:59 EET 1999","creator":"glynn@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"glynn@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Sat Mar 20 01:01:59 EET 1999","text":"Cannot verify as crasher at plugin invocation present on Mac, but looks fixed on Win and Linux in March 19 Seamonkey builds.
