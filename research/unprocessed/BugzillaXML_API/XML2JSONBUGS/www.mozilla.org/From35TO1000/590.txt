And there are two of them:  1) the first list doesn't reflow properly when the image size arrives  2) the 3rd list doesn't either and it's in a table; you have to work hard to get the table to reflow.  I'll look into this more and determine where the incremental reflow is going awry.","id":1838,"bug_id":590,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Sep 26 18:38:59 EEST 1998","creator":"kipp@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"kipp@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Sat Sep 26 18:38:59 EEST 1998","text":"I've modified the frame-image-loader API's and implementation so that a callback can be specified. I've hooked it up (for now) to just the case where a reflow is needed. The previous code automatically took the frame, found it's content and then triggered a content-changed reflow. All well and good *if the frame had content*. Well, image bullets don't have content anymore so they weren't getting notified when the image had been loaded.","id":1839,"bug_id":590,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Jan 29 05:50:59 EET 1999","creator":"elig@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"elig@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Jan 29 05:50:59 EET 1999","text":"Verified fixed using 1.28.99 build (on Mac OS, Win 32, Linux.)  I do note that the images on the test page on Mac & Linux are stacked on top of each other vertically; i.e. the 3-4 pixel row of white space that occurs on the Win32 build [and IE] doesn't take place on these platforms.  Will probably split into a separate bug and write up, unless already written up.","id":1840,"bug_id":590,"tags":[]}]}
