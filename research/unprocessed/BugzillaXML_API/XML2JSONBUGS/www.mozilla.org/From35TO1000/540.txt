Actually, I can understand why it would be scary.  I suggest, as a way of preventing just anyone from changing the description at will, why not make it so that only the reporter can change the description?  I think this might just do the trick...  It would allow the reporter to correct his mistakes, AND prevent others from just changing it on the fly.  After all, others can already add additional comments if something needs clarification, and they can already change the short summary if it needs to be changed...  And I've already seen people do this before many, many times.  Or, I see another possible solution: if a description REALLY needs changing, why not simply mark the original bug as invalid, close it, and open a new bug with a new description?  I've also seen this done before.  See bug 5207 and bug 5209 for an example of this.  So maybe this feature isn't really necessary at all? And after all, if someone REALLY wanted to botch the original description, they could already do this, too.  Of course, doubtless there are many other security holes in Bugzilla like this if you look carefully enough.  BTW, I do have another suggestion though: perhaps Bugzilla should be able to form links on plural phrases like \"bugs 5027 and 5209\" as well as how I've done it above, for referring to multiple bugs, highlighting the \"5027\" and \"5209\" parts if it encounters the word \"bugs?\"","id":1546,"bug_id":540,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Apr 13 14:31:05 EEST 2000","creator":"terry@mozilla.org","author":"terry@mozilla.org","time":"Thu Apr 13 14:31:05 EEST 2000","text":"tara@tequilarista.org is the new owner of Bugzilla and Bonsai.

Allow people in a certain group to edit all comments. In the default installation, only the maintainer would have this privilege. Currently the maintainer can already do this using SQL, so in theory this would not change much. This feature must be used carefully.  2.) Allow people to edit their own comments for a certain time. Installations that do not want this could set the time limit to 0. Maybe a good time limit would be something between an hour and a day.   A possible problem with the second feature is the case where someone else has already posted a followup on your comment, referring to something you want to change. This can occur even in case of typos, grammar errors etc. - Maybe a preview feature (see freshmeat for an example) should be used for this job instead, letting you fix typos _before_ you submit your comment? - Or is it possibile to require confirmation for such a change from the one who already posted a followup? Looks like this is not a practical solution. If you miss something in the preview, is it really so bad if only a certain group of people can change it?  Other possibilities that may be worth thinking about, especially useful for long bugs: - Introduce a new \"long summary\" field with the original bug description as the initial value, and make it editable by everyone with the editbugs permission (and maybe the reporter). In a bug view, this field should only be shown if its value is different from the original bug description, or alternatively it should always be shown, replacing the initial bug description field (with a clear visual indication that it serves a different purpose than the additional comments). The history of the changes to the bug description field should be stored as a sequence of diffs, conceptually like CVS version files, and each diff could show up as an additional comment. This way, the additional comments would be more like a discussion log, whereas the \"long summary\" field would always contain a detailed, up-to-date description. This would be a useful feature for everyone who is short of time and wants to get the \"details\" of a bug (like PDT) without having to scan through all the comments. - Alternatively, something similar could be achieved with a simpler, but less beautiful hack: Have a link at the beginning pointing to the \"most recent detailed summary comment\". By default, it points to the original bug description (and in this case it need not show up in the bug view at all), but anyone with editbugs priviledges can change it to point to an arbitrary comment. This way one could always jump to the important comments quickly.  Additionally or alternatively, there could be such a \"pointer to a comment\" that causes all previous comments to be hidden from the default bug view and only be displayed on demand (a \"show all comments\" link, or a \"show previous comments\").  What do you think? How many new bugs should be filed for these suggestions?

Specifically, the ability for a user to edit *their own* comment, for a (admin defineable) period of time.  Also, it makes sense to enable a feature to allow the administrator to edit comments, since he/she can easily do it directly in the database with SQL anyway.  I do understand why Gerv and others say that \"changing history\" is bad, and I largely agree.  However, I would think that Bugzilla should, as much as possible, allow the administrator of a particular site to make these choices.  Call it personal philosophy, but I think tools should (within reason) conform to the user's methodology, and not enforce a methodology on it's users.  In my own case, I just cannot stand it when I make a typo in a comment, and am forced to leave it there.  Yeah, call me anal or pedantic or whatever, but it just annoys me...  I'd absolutely love a window of time where I can go back and fix mistakes like that.    Could even that facility be abused? Yes.  Is that a big deal? I say that that is for the site admin to decide.

I know this would probably make the resolution to this bug not- so-trivial, but it might make all parties happy.  Why not add two fields to the longdescs table : 'comment_id' and 'overrides'.  After patching Bugzilla with the patch that adds these two fields,  checksetup.pl would assign sequential numbers to each comment for  the 'comment_id' field, and would set 'overrides=NULL' for each one.  Then, let's say user 'bob' edits their comment, which is 'comment_id=15149'.  The new comment would be added as any comment, for  example, 'comment_id=457498', but the difference would be that it would  have 'overrides=15149'.  show_bug.cgi would then display the comments, but when a comment is overriden  by another one, the new one is displayed, with a line like the following at the  top or bottom :  Edited by <who> <bug_when> (Original comment)                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                             link to show_comment.cgi?id=15149 (show_comment.cgi = new script, but wouldn't be too complicated, just displays  the comment...)  The advantages : - No \"rewriting history\" since the original comment is still available, and if    an admin doesn't like the edit that was made, he can just delete the new    comment's row from the longdescs table. - Easily scales for multiple edits, and could look like this :    Edited by <who> <bug_when> (Previous comment)   Which was Edited by <who> <bug_when> (Previous comment)   Which was Edited by <who> <bug_when> (Previous comment)   Which was Edited by <who> <bug_when> (Original comment)    (just a suggestion...)  Personally, I have no interest in this bug. I have never found any use for  editing my bugs, because I find typos harmless, and my Bugzilla is internal, so  I have no confidential informations I need to edit out.

Not only is it ugly, it has a negative usability impact as well. The ability to go back and fix up typos is a bonus, but it pales in comparison to the ability to fix line and page-widths.  As such, the ability for admins to conveniently edit such comments from within Bugzilla would be extremely helpful. As things currently stand, manipulating the database by hand is the only alternative. Or suppressing the problem comment by marking it as \"insiders only\" (but even then, insiders still have to put up with the excessive page widths).  To illustrate the problem, here's a bug that I just posted in my own install (Bugzilla 2.22 series):  http://wincent.com/a/support/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=504  The long lines cause the entire page to become wider, requiring horizontal scrolling in order to read it. (As a side issue, note how I unwittingly triggered the long lines by starting the line with a \">\", trying to quote it; as noted in bug #11901, quoted paragraphs are left unwrapped... which makes me wonder if there is a way for me to manually quote text without having to hard wrap it myself...)","id":3038186,"bug_id":540,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Jul 20 17:24:11 EEST 2007","creator":"paulspencer@mindspring.com","author":"paulspencer@mindspring.com","time":"Fri Jul 20 17:24:11 EEST 2007","text":"I have the following reasons for changing the \"long description\":  1) typ-o in the text.  2) Over the lifetime of the bug, the initial description may need to be  updated to better describe the actual bug.

In my company we use a crappy bug system and want to switch. I am currently trying to get bugzilla on top of the list, but I know that some people in R&D are currently trying other softwares (proprietary one). I have not done my demonstration with bugzilla yet, but I fear that one blocking point may be this impossibility to edit comments (because in the current bug system we use, people often change the last comment).  What would be good is to set several possible kinds of permissions: - edit the description; - edit only one's comments; - edit only the last comment (if it is yours); -> this enables to change only your unanswered comments (for the philosophical objections about changing the past); this is how it currently works with the current bug system we use and I think it a good compromise.  Any of these above permissions would let an history of change (maybe a link in the comment header?). And some other permissions that should be enabled only to people with admin rights: - edit any comment; - delete comments; - edit/delete without history (a special option for editing/deleting irreversably, all the considerations above about confidential info to remove for instance).","id":3297812,"bug_id":540,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed May 28 00:38:58 EEST 2008","creator":"remember.pol@gmail.com","author":"remember.pol@gmail.com","time":"Wed May 28 00:38:58 EEST 2008","text":"It's coming up to the 10 year mark since this bug was created... I really think comment#63 and #76 have some potential here.  Max Kanat-Alexander, any updates?  Obviously hierarchy/security are issues that need to be discussed and planned out.  Essentially, say a full edit feature IS implemented... this means that the next version, of say for example the bugzilla running HERE on mozilla.org, will have the facility for the entire database history to be edited. If the \"#1 maintainer\"'s account gets compromised.. then the hacker could delete everything in the bugzilla.mozilla.org DB. Not good.  I think that modern WikiWiki implementations can be studied for a good example in this context.  (As far as reverting vandalized history, and security, etc.)  One thing I think would be smart is to allow the author of a bug to edit any comment in the bug.  The author of any comment can edit his own comment, (obviously that's the whole point)  And the next issue is how to control the edit status.  Most message boards display an indicator like 'this message was edited by ** at **'.  For starters, I think this should be enabled by default and permanently, until the security issues related to that specific topic have been further discussed.  For example.. say I'm posting a bug and I'm being sloppy about my window management while multitasking... I somehow post the bug with a password to some account in the message because, you know, 'oops, wrong box'.  I edit the comment, removing the password. BUT, it says 'edited by ** at **'.  Obviously you'd want such a mistake to have no record whatsoever, just for peace of mind. You don't want others to be thinking 'hmm wonder what he edited', when in fact is was such a grave mistake.  Like most things, this can also be reverse/negatively exploited.

Comment lists can get long and cumbersome, especially if plagued with minor edits and corrections.

Superseded comments would remain in the comment list as-is (default collapsed to reduce space use), and with a link to the superseding comment. As a special case, a subset of users (I suggest only the Author and Assignee, as an extension only if they have permission) could mark the description as superseded, which would put a copy of the description superseding comment in the \"description\" location, with a \"supersedes\" link to \"comment 0\" which would be the original description (default collapsed).  Multiple supersedes would be handled by providing the transient set of links - ie   -------  Comment #99 <details>   (+) [reply] -------  superseded by comment 102 superseded by comment 105  and  -------  Comment #105 <details>   (+) [reply] -------  supersedes comment 102 supersedes comment 99  In order to support this 1 additional column would be required, either supersedes or superseded, depending on ease of implementation of link direction.","id":3999816,"bug_id":540,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Mar 04 11:12:37 EET 2009","creator":"matthias.thullner@de.bosch.com","author":"matthias.thullner@de.bosch.com","time":"Wed Mar 04 11:12:37 EET 2009","text":"(In reply to comment #99) > > OK, so the next question is security of comment editing.

Yes, but you've already email spammed unless you are running you email as a cron script..  I would say that if this were ever implemented that it needs to be default disabled in administrative parameters. Some (many?) organizations and companies will not want this ability.

This kind of comments is indeed useless as you are not the first one to blame developers that such or such feature or bug is the most important one and that it's a shame that the bug is still not resolved promptly. On the contrary, such comments have the opposite effect as we tend to consider as spam emails coming from such bugs and sometimes don't even bother reading them.  That being said:  (In reply to Kyle Repinski from comment #138) > I realized that I could have worded my comment better but rather > than editing it I had to instead quote it and add on to it, adding another > comment to the bug and sending out yet another e-mail to everybody on the CC > list.  That's one of the key problems already mentioned in this bug: if someone fixes some typos in a comment, it's indeed useless to spam people. But if someone edits half of the comment, then it makes sense to email people again, because that's not negligible. We cannot delay when to send the initial emails just because someone may edit his own comment right after submitting it. But we also don't want to let someone entirely change his comment after emails have been sent, because what you would get in your email would not match what is now really displayed in the bug itself. And if you edit the comment after someone already replied, then the reply may now look inappropriate, which would generate confusion.  Typos honestly don't need to be fixed (it falls into the category of \"it would be nice if we could do it\", but it's not essential). If a more consequent change is required, then posting a whole new comment makes sense.

I don't strictly want what this bug is about - editable comments, but every other related bug seems to end up being duped here, so this is the only reasonable place to discuss what I think are legitimate needs/desires that are not met currently.  Use Case 1. Bug is reported. It's a legitimate bug, but has a *woeful* description (aka comment 0) (I'm sure we've all seen examples :-/). After about 50 comments someone writes a stunningly beautiful description of the bug. But 10 comments later no one can see the *good* description, they're left with the original description.  Use Case 2. Comment 50 has a great analysis, but then at comment 78 someone points out a flaw. There's no link from comment 50 to comment 78, so people reading the bug may not see it, links from other bugs directly to comment 50 are not up to date with the latest understanding.  Use Case 3. An off-topic conversation is held in the bug, making it harder to find the \"meat\" of the bug.  Use Case 4. Soon after entering a comment you realize you accidentally said the opposite of what you meant. \"Of course this will be a problem when we implement widgety class\". (Oops won't be a problem...)  Use Case 5. Type with no impact on content.  My concern is once a bug gets \"long\" (like this one, this looks like it will be comment 143), it's not realistic to expect everyone to read all the comments, so people miss the important comments, the corrections to the description, the correction to a point made 5 comments later and so on. I am ignoring the \"spam\" implications, email options is somewhat orthogonal I think.  What is the fundamental problem? The comment system is trying to do 2 things - capture history (sort of like forum software) and provide a working analysis of the bug.  I made one suggestion to solve this at comment 100. There are some other reasonable ideas scattered through this bug, although I think the only patches provided have exactly the problems expressed in comment 140 - there's no obviously right answer if you allow people to *actually* edit comments.  One less radical approach would be to allow certain classes of users grade comments, and then comments below some threshold (could be Boolean) would be by default hidden. That does not address what I consider the *biggest* problem - that the description is comment 0, and you can't ever change it.   However, I guess that \"comment 0\" problem could be solved by adding a custom \"Extended Summary\" field, and using the current \"description\" strictly as \"comment 0\", which could be done by customization of an installation, without code change.","id":6699722,"bug_id":540,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Oct 05 01:33:01 EEST 2012","creator":"peter.jackson@rocksoft.com","author":"peter.jackson@rocksoft.com","time":"Fri Oct 05 01:33:01 EEST 2012","text":"(In reply to Peter Jackson from comment #143)  > Type with no impact on content.

Mailing lists are great for chatting, but for more serious purposes, I would suggest a Wiki approach - Wikis are a perfect when a topic needs focus: People can refine the Wiki, and bad edits can be rolled back. As a matter of fact, it also works extremely well for sites like stackoverflow to find an answer for a specific problem.  So maybe instead of making comments editable, an alternative would be to simply add a Wiki on top of all the comments. Then, everybody could choose to subscribe either to the wiki, or to the comment stream, or both.  Ideally, some people would browse through the comments regularly, and update the wiki accordingly.

It's a legitimate bug, but has a *woeful* description (aka > comment 0) (I'm sure we've all seen examples :-/).  That's pretty common, right. :) But when we have correctly identified the root cause of the problem, we already have several additional comments asking the reporter to give more information about the issue, or ask QA to try to reproduce, and then developers jump in and manage to identify what the problem is. If we were suddenly editing comment 0 to reflect all the discussion into a single comment, this would make all these subsequent comments obsolete, which would make the reading of the bug pretty confusing. So we agree that editing comment 0 in this case is not the right approach. What could be done in this case, and some Bugzilla installations have done it already, is to have a custom text field which contains the current state of the bug, with the correctly identified root cause and the solution to fix the problem. This text field could even contain references to the relevant comments in the bug. This way, you would most of the time (unless you need all the details) only need to read this text field and ignore all the comments. Admins are already free to create such a custom field.   > Use Case 2. > Comment 50 has a great analysis, but then at comment 78 someone points out a > flaw. There's no link from comment 50 to comment 78  What we do in this case is to add to the status whiteboard e.g. [see comment 78 for the description of the problem, and comment 122 for a solution], or something similar. Each team manage bugs as they want, but that's what we sometimes do in long bugs.   > Use Case 3. > An off-topic conversation is held in the bug, making it harder to find the > \"meat\" of the bug.  Instead of editing/deleting these comments, we plan to implement a different approach for such comments, see bug 793963: the idea is that users being members of some \"privileged\" group are allowed to tag comments, and once a comment gets the tag \"spam\" or \"obsolete\", it is hidden/collapsed by default. So only relevant and neutral comments would still be displayed by default, which would decrease what you need to read. We could also imagine a \"important\" or \"highlight\" tag which would make such comments more prominent.   > Use Case 4. > Soon after entering a comment you realize you accidentally said the opposite > of what you meant. \"Of course this will be a problem when we implement > widgety class\".

Those two cases are the only ones where editing comments would make sense, but again, only if we don't let the author edit the whole comment after emails have been sent.

Then why not close this bug as WONTFIX if the Bugzilla team ultimately thinks editing comments is bad?

It embeds the comment edit textarea into the comments themselves so no need for a separate page.

The reason is pretty obvious: read all the comments from core developers who are against this bug (aka WONTFIX) or who disagree on the way to implement it.
