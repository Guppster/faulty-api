By setting DIV { margin: 0 } in the test documetn, I'm able to remove the spacing between the two DIV elements. So it seems like the margin has something to do with it. I suggest making DIV { margin:0 } the default behavior (but you are, of course, free encode this any way you want interally)  BTW, I tested Nav4 and the existance of a DIV elemement didn't seem to alter the spacing between the elements, so I think this is the best behavior for backwards compatibility as well.","id":3072,"bug_id":811,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Nov 20 22:40:59 EET 1998","creator":"kipp@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"kipp@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Nov 20 22:40:59 EET 1998","text":"DIV margins (top/bottom) are going to be auto for backwards compatability.","id":3073,"bug_id":811,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Feb 05 22:04:59 EET 1999","creator":"glynn@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"glynn@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Feb 05 22:04:59 EET 1999","text":"Verifying as fixed, Seamonkey Feb4","id":3074,"bug_id":811,"tags":[]}]}
