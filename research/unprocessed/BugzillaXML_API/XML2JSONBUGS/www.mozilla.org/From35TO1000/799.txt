On the first visit to slashdot after starting mozilla, the page begins to load correctly.  Text is laid out, and images fill in one by one. When the image for the banner ad at the top of the page loads, the table jumps up to the top of the page with the banner ad overlapping it. The area to the left of the banner ad becomes black. There's also some cruft along the right hand edge of the page. Pressing back and then forward results in the page laying out correctly. Pressing reload 2 or 3 times also works. It also seems like sometimes the banner image gets clipped resulting in a square image.  It looks like the page author has gone to a lot of trouble to make something that loads with both navigator and msie as well as working around problems with the ilayer tag.  It looks like the banner ad mozilla is displaying is part of a <NOLAYER> block. Isn't that a bug too?  mozilla version: updated from cvs Saturday morning, Sept 12","id":2967,"bug_id":799,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Oct 14 18:29:59 EEST 1998","creator":"toshok@gmail.com","author":"toshok@gmail.com","time":"Wed Oct 14 18:29:59 EEST 1998","text":"toshok@netscape.com => toshok@hungry.com","id":2968,"bug_id":799,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Dec 15 07:41:59 EET 1998","creator":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Dec 15 07:41:59 EET 1998","text":"Old bug, old codebase.
