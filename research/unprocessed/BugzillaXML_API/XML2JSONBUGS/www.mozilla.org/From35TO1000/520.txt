Here is a copy of what was sent:  From: kevinmca@nsclean.com Reply-to: kevinmca@nsclean.com To: win95_cbug@netscape.com Subject: 4.5b1 - Windows 95 (95 and 98) - missing registry entries which hose up the NSClean product     Submitter name:                Kevin McAleavey    Submitter email address:       kevinmca@nsclean.com    Product:                       Communicator    Version:                       4.5b1  Personal Edition: Personal Edition     Operating system:              Windows 95    OS version:                    95 and 98    Browser_type:                  Windows 32-bit    Language:    Issue summary:                 missing registry entries which hose up the NSClean product  Issue details:  In all earlier versions of Communicator, there was an entry in  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\NETSCAPE\\NETSCAPE  NAVIGATOR\\USERS pointing to the current user and subkeys for each user profile  which contained an entry called \"DirRoot\" which in turn pointed to the path where  prefs.js could be found permitting NSClean to locate prefs.js to locate the files which  NSClean processes.     We've since found \"Biff\" entries in HKCU but none point to the location of the \\users\\  folder under Program Files and as you know, people can place their Netscape  anywhere on the drive and will often relocate the \\users\\ folders. This in turn has  caused Privacy Software Corporation and its customers untold expense and hassle.     As a result, we are presently informing our customers to AVOID the Netscape 4.5b1  product and are gravely concerned about how Netscape is going to resolve this  missing data our product depends on.     Are there any plans to correct this and provide a registry pointer to where that folder  is located or do we need to talk to Jim B about it?

It's also not a bug in libreg but apparently in the lack of data in the windows registry and/or the data a client of libreg has chosen to put in there, which I have nothing to do with.  The source for libreg is part of Mozilla, and thus available under NPL, by the way. If nothing else you could read the headers and call the .DLL 4.5 installs on the user's system.
