The child frameset specified the border to be 10 pixels wide, which causes the gap to appear even though the parent specified the border to be 0 pixels.  I'd say that the html of this page is flawed...  However since Nav and IE both do not allow child framesets to over-ride the parent border settings, this is a compatability issue.  Since this is a deprecated attribute anyway, we should probably aim for backwards compatability here, I'll see if I can break us to match IE and Nav. :)","id":1990,"bug_id":624,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Dec 23 05:35:59 EET 1999","creator":"ekrock@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"ekrock@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Thu Dec 23 05:35:59 EET 1999","text":"Removing [MAKINGTEST] csbooton@myna.com.
