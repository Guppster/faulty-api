I recently sent the following mail to devinfo@netscape.com:  Hi! I'm writing a window application in JS/DHTML that utilizes plugins within layers. I'm having problems with the stacking order of plugin windows inside layers. The plugins inside the layer is not placed within the layer container, instead it seems like the plugin window \"floats\" above, and when two layers with plugin windows are placed on top of eachother, the both plugin windows \"fight\" for the right to be viewed, that is, they flickers a lot, like 40 times per second when they trade places (in view order). I have tried several ways of using plugins (EMBED and OBJECT tag) in layers but it is does not work either way, as well as tried several different type of plugins but it seem to be a general error with the way Netscape handle plugin OLE windows. I've tried on different versions of Netscape Navigator on Windows 95/NT4.0 SP3, from version 4.02 to 4.06 and it is the same problem. Please let me know if there is any way to work around this problem. With best regards Per Andersson Cherry Casino Group  And after that I received the following mail:  Per, Thank you for your inquiry. To Submit Code Source Bugs please go to: http://www.mozilla.org/bugs/. For further assistance, please contact the Developer Response Center at 650.937.2986. Thanks, Lionel Edgar Developer Relations Representative Netscape Communications Corporation  And here I am. I hope I'm at the right place. The bug report is as above, nothing more to add to it. Please let me know if this lead to anything (like a fix in version 2.5 or 4.6).
