On startup, Mozilla immediately resizes itself, moving the firebreathing lizard logo downwards, and then drawing the three toolbars at the top of the window a second time.  The new set do not appear to be functional (when I push the buttons, nothing happens).  The 'balloon help'-like floating tags (what are those things called anyway?) have debug info in them, instead of the names that appear next to the original button bars.  This info is:  For \"Navigation Toolbar\" it says \"Debug: no tipString resource for widget Tab3 This message only appears in a DEBUG build\"  For \"Location Toolbar\" it says the same thing, only with \"Tab4\" in place of \"Tab3\".  The third tool bar I usually keep minimized, and it doesn't have any \"balloon help\" here.  I can minimize the extra toolbars, and they seem to pretty much go away, although they leave a slightly thick line between the 'real' toolbars and the main window.  The platform where I'm seeing this is Data General DG/UX UNIX.  I don't know if this problem shows up on other platforms or not.","id":2630,"bug_id":738,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Sep 09 09:05:59 EEST 1998","creator":"ramiro@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"ramiro@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Sep 09 09:05:59 EEST 1998","text":"Reassign to slamm@netscape.com","id":2631,"bug_id":738,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Sep 09 16:26:59 EEST 1998","creator":"slamm@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"slamm@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Sep 09 16:26:59 EEST 1998","text":"The new toolsbars on the bottom are the ones that are going to stay.
