Anyway, I've noticed problems with all of the versions of Netscape Navigator that I've used thus far (up to 4.06) that when you do a \"Save Link As\" there is not only no status, but if you start more than one at a time they tend to crash -- You can't close the windows and they don't close themselves.  But, the navigator window still remains available.    I've experienced this problem on a PC running windows 95 with a 28.8 connection.     Another thing I noticed is that in the logon for this thingamabob where I'm writing you this note, if you enter a valid E-Mail address and an incorrect password, you get a \"Server Error\".  You also get this same error if you enter and Email address and password, and then click to have you mail the password.     Hope that this can in some way be useful to you guys.  Keep up all of the good work!  :)    - jim.","id":3836,"bug_id":939,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Oct 08 23:39:59 EEST 1998","creator":"blythe@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"blythe@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Thu Oct 08 23:39:59 EEST 1998","text":"Save Link As isn't reproducable by me.
