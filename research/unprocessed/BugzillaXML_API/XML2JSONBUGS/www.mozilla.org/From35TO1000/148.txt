The last one was a bit tricky, but I figured it out.  It boils down to the fact that the compiler just eliminates the call because it simplifies to if(!1). So, you take the variable out of the picture when that case occurs (global threads).  --- prucv.c     Sun Apr 12 00:33:55 1998 +++ prucv.old.c Wed Apr 08 17:55:09 1998 @@ -157,9 +157,7 @@ void _PR_NotifyLockedThread (PRThread *t  PRStatus _PR_WaitCondVar(      PRThread *thread, PRCondVar *cvar, PRLock *lock, PRIntervalTime timeout)  { -#ifndef _PR_GLOBAL_THREADS_ONLY /* is isn''t used in that context */      intn is; -#endif      PRStatus rv = PR_SUCCESS;       PR_ASSERT(thread == _PR_MD_CURRENT_THREAD()); @@ -530,10 +528,8 @@ PR_IMPLEMENT(PRStatus) PR_NotifyCondVar(  */  PR_IMPLEMENT(PRStatus) PR_NotifyAllCondVar(PRCondVar *cvar)  { -#ifndef _PR_GLOBAL_THREADS_ONLY /* is and q not used in that context */      PRCList *q;      PRIntn is; -#endif      PRThread *me = _PR_MD_CURRENT_THREAD();       PR_ASSERT(cvar->lock->owner == me); @@ -618,11 +614,7 @@ PR_IMPLEMENT(PRStatus) PRP_NakedNotify(P  PR_IMPLEMENT(PRStatus) PRP_NakedBroadcast(PRCondVar *cvar)  {      PRCList *q; -#ifndef _PR_GLOBAL_THREADS_ONLY -    /* since this is all macro''ed, we get a warning in the above case due to -       the compiler throwing out the call and thinking the var goes unrefed */      PRIntn is; -#endif      PRThread *me = _PR_MD_CURRENT_THREAD();      PR_ASSERT(_PR_NAKED_CV_LOCK == cvar->lock); Updated by Wan-Teh Chang (wtc@netscape.com) on Friday, April 24, 1998 12:33:41 PM PDT Additional Details : Assigned bug to myself.","id":271,"bug_id":148,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Dec 17 04:41:59 EET 1998","creator":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Thu Dec 17 04:41:59 EET 1998","text":"Ditto on this one.","id":272,"bug_id":148,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Mar 06 07:09:59 EET 1999","creator":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Sat Mar 06 07:09:59 EET 1999","text":"per leger, assigning QA contacts to all open bugs without QA contacts according to list at http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Browser","id":273,"bug_id":148,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Mar 17 20:04:59 EET 1999","creator":"phillip@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"phillip@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Mar 17 20:04:59 EET 1999","text":"Wan-Teh, these are some pretty old bugs. i can't help but assume they have been fixed by now.
