Since the index files in the ns_imap directory are from the user before (not comparing to the ones that should be there), messenger exits.  This problem also happens if index-files are killed, \"remember password option\" is activated and you are starting the messenger. Messenger thinks that index files are there, connects the imap server with password in preferences.js, but crashes. If you disable \"remember password\", messenger will ask for pw, after correct entered pw, messenger re-creates missing index files. Messenger should not crash in any of the above situations.
