I noticed that when attempting to build  mozilla/modules/libpref/src/prefapi.c  the compile command has a -I../dist/security element but there is no corresponding directory in 'dist'.  If I create one and copy the contents of .../module/security/freenav/ then things seem to compile much better.  I have no way of knowing if those are the CORRECT .h files but they do make the error messages go away.
