If I edit /etc/hosts and point rdf.netscape.com to some invalid ip address then mozilla will start up without freezing but i'm unable to follow links. A few minutes later a blank popup appears (presumably an error message) and two scrollbar sized strips along the right and bottom edges of the frame start flashing between gray and white.  Looking in gdb, it looks like there's an infinite loop with the code thrashing around between doc_bbox_changed_func and scroller_resize. Every few iterations in doc_bbox_changed_func the bounding box has a height and width of zero.","id":2723,"bug_id":755,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Sep 09 09:04:59 EEST 1998","creator":"ramiro@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"ramiro@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Sep 09 09:04:59 EEST 1998","text":"I just checked in a fix for this, try updating mozilla/cmd/xfe/scroll.c and see what happens.

I had a copy of mozilla sitting open a couple days at http://slashdot.org and went back to it and reloaded. It slowly reloaded and continued for a long time with the scrollbars flashing. I grabbed it with gdb and got a stack trace. The beginning of it is http://cannibal.mi.org/~dawn/sandbox/infiniteloop.txt. The entire trace was several hundred lines long. I restarted mozilla right away and the same thing happened. I tried to look at it a couple hours later and everything worked fine.","id":2728,"bug_id":755,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Dec 15 07:32:59 EET 1998","creator":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Dec 15 07:32:59 EET 1998","text":"Old bug, old codebase.
