I don't have that file, and so I am unable to test out the nightly build. I will go and try and harvest it from Microsoft's site, but it would be nice to have a link to this somewhere on the Binaries Download page.  By the time someone reads this, I will probably have found a suitable URL. Get in touch with me, and I will give it to you.  All this is contingent on the assumption that MFC42D.DLL is a freely-distributable file.","id":2386,"bug_id":704,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Sep 17 09:12:59 EEST 1998","creator":"jlawson@hmc.edu","author":"jlawson@hmc.edu","time":"Thu Sep 17 09:12:59 EEST 1998","text":"This is noted on the nightly builds page.","id":2387,"bug_id":704,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Feb 25 17:47:59 EET 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Thu Feb 25 17:47:59 EET 1999","text":"Old bug..marking as Verified.","id":2388,"bug_id":704,"tags":[]}]}
