Keeping the js engine as warning-free as possible is a goal.  This particular warning came up a while ago... I don't remember the details, but I do remember that we decided to ignore it.  gcc is complaining about dead code here - the compiler warning mechanism kicks in before the dead code elimination does.  Brendan had a fix that removed the warning at the cost of a runtime check, but decided that it was really more of a problem with gcc than with javascript, and didn't justify the workaround. Esthetic arguments should be directed to brendan@mozilla.org.","id":966,"bug_id":387,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Jun 07 22:56:59 EEST 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Mon Jun 07 22:56:59 EEST 1999","text":"Changing component to \"Javascript Engine\".  \"Javascript\" component is being retired.","id":967,"bug_id":387,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Jan 06 05:46:40 EET 2001","creator":"jruderman@gmail.com","author":"jruderman@gmail.com","time":"Sat Jan 06 05:46:40 EET 2001","text":"[mass change] these bugs are closed but have no resolution.  reopening...","id":553917,"bug_id":387,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Jan 06 06:02:23 EET 2001","creator":"jruderman@gmail.com","author":"jruderman@gmail.com","time":"Sat Jan 06 06:02:23 EET 2001","text":"marking as wontfix.","id":553974,"bug_id":387,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Jan 13 02:14:26 EET 2003","creator":"brant@gurganus.name","author":"brant@gurganus.name","time":"Mon Jan 13 02:14:26 EET 2003","text":"VERIFIED due to more than 365 days since last change","id":1707288,"bug_id":387,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Jul 01 07:22:11 EEST 2004","creator":"timeless@bemail.org","author":"timeless@bemail.org","time":"Thu Jul 01 07:22:11 EEST 2004","text":"jsmath.c: In function `random_init': jsmath.c:332: warning: right shift count is negative jsmath.c:336: warning: right shift count is negative  i'm just a bit curious about these (first noticed them on doppler/darwin).","id":2191151,"bug_id":387,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Jul 02 01:02:41 EEST 2004","creator":"nallen@acm.org","author":"nallen@acm.org","time":"Fri Jul 02 01:02:41 EEST 2004","text":"It looks like you should only get those warnings when  1) you don't have real long longs 2) you shift left by at least 32 bits 3) your compiler generates warnings for macro expanded code before eliminating dead code in an |if| never taken","id":2191950,"bug_id":387,"tags":[]}]}
