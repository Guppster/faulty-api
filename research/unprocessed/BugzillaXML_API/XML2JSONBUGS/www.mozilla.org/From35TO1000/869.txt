The window is quite larger if you measure the extra pixels used by the chrome and the scrollbar area.  In NGLayout, this opens a window that is 315x320, including all chrome.  Note that in Nav4, if scrollbars are specified (as in this example) there is space left to the right of the content area for scrollbars, but no scrollbars are there if they're not necessary (as in this example).  Anyway, it's the whole innerWidth/outerWidth thing.  Also, NGLayout appears to be trying to render a scrollbar, even though one is not necessary for this example.","id":3404,"bug_id":869,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Oct 02 22:57:59 EEST 1998","creator":"joki@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"joki@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Oct 02 22:57:59 EEST 1998","text":"This is waiting on new widget API's to allow access to this info.","id":3405,"bug_id":869,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Feb 03 16:08:59 EET 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Feb 03 16:08:59 EET 1999","text":"Setting all current Open/Normal to M4.","id":3406,"bug_id":869,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Mar 06 07:31:59 EET 1999","creator":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Sat Mar 06 07:31:59 EET 1999","text":"per leger, assigning QA contacts to all open bugs without QA contacts according to list at http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Browser","id":3407,"bug_id":869,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Apr 05 21:37:59 EEST 1999","creator":"joki@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"joki@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Mon Apr 05 21:37:59 EEST 1999","text":"We're not spending time fixing chrome in the viewer so this should be for apprunner.
