The file mozilla/nsprpub/pr/include/md/_linux.h does not contain the definitions for _MD_GET_SP, _MD_SET_FP, etc.  Also, gcc on ARM Linux defines, by default, characters as unsigned, while an explicit manifest for all Linux platforms defines HAVE_SIGNED_CHAR. So, either the manifest must be undefined or an explicit compilation flag must be added.  The enclosed file contains the changes to make the build work (I also added extra flags for C++ to overcome a current limitation of NetWinder standard libraries - they shouldn't hurt, assumed Mozilla does not use C++ exceptions and rtti, but they can be removed when these libraries get fixed).  With these changes Mozilla correctly builds on NetWinder using LessTif. moz-export crashes while loading, but mozilla-export start and can be used for a while (then it crashes or hung the system).","id":3470,"bug_id":883,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Sep 24 18:54:59 EEST 1998","creator":"ramiro@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"ramiro@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Thu Sep 24 18:54:59 EEST 1998","text":"Adding wtc@netscape.com.
