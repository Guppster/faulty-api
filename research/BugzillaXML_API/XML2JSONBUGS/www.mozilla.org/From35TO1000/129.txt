Wan-Teh's bug assignment to djw  didn't go through properly because the assigned to field was still bugzilla@mozilla.org.

This does not happen anywhere currently and that is why we do not see any problems.  Just initializing lo_image to NULL is not going to fix this case because the switch statement in lo_ImageObserver also contains lo_image dereferencing statements that are not guarded by a NULL check for lo_image.  The patch that fixes the problem you caught has just been checked into the mozilla tree.  I'll post the URL to it on this bug report.
