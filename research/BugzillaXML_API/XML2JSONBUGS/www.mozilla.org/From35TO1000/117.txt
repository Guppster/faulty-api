Added myself to the CC list.  Brian: we should use -fPIC instead of -fpic. ns/nsprpub/config/Linux.mk uses -fPIC.  -fPIC allows you to have large-displacement branches. Updated by Brian Ostrom (briano@netscape.com) on Tuesday, July 14, 1998 5:42:04 PM PDT Additional Details : I think this is fixed now.  I added -fPIC to the compile line for all Linux processor-variants.  It doesn't seem to hurt anything to do so.
