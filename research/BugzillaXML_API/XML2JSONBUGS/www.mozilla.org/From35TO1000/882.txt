That's because the Windows version of nsButton.h uses NS_DECL_ISUPPORTS which gets a mRefCnt member data declared, but the constructor doesn't use NS_INIT_REFCNT() to initialize the member data  I would have added that, but that isn't sufficient because nsBaseWidget also uses NS_DECL_ISUPPORTS which means that nsButton really has two mRefCnt member data. That's bad and needs to be fixed  Troy","id":3463,"bug_id":882,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Sep 24 17:55:59 EEST 1998","creator":"kmcclusk@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"kmcclusk@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Thu Sep 24 17:55:59 EEST 1998","text":"Stopped using NS_DECL_ISUPPORTS macro on any Windows widget that derives From nsBaseWidget.h.
