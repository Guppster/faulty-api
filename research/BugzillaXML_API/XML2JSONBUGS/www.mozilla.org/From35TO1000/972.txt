The current code on WIN32 only looks to see if the font weight is greater or less than 400 and sets the logical font to be either bold or normal.  The solution is to interpret the font weight given as an explicit font weight if it divides without a remainder into 100. So font sizes of 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900. would be passed through as the logical font weight on WIN32. If the remainder is 1-9. which is the case for a font weight of say 301, 402, etc, then the remainder should be interpreted as a the number of times to make the font bolder. This involves looking for next boldest weight for the font. If the remainder is 99-91 this should be interpreted as the number of times to make the font lighter, where (100-remainder) returns the number of times to make it lighter. All other raminder values (10-90) will not be allowed. The CSS Style code will clamp the maximum remainder at 9 when making it bolder, and clamp it at 91 when making it lighter. The current constants in nsStyleConsts uses increments of 101 and -101 when making it bolder and lighter. These need to be changed to 1 and -1. However, This change can not be checked in until all three platforms honor this.  There should be a separate bug filed for Mac and Linux on this, since all of the work is in the platform specific code.","id":4061,"bug_id":972,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Sep 20 21:33:59 EEST 1999","creator":"kmcclusk@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"kmcclusk@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Mon Sep 20 21:33:59 EEST 1999","text":"Add support for font weights on WIN32.

Only if the font has the other weights; that should work right now on the trunk, though there have been some changes to that code recently.  There was a question regarding 600 -- the CSS spec says:  > If any of the values '600', '700', '800' or '900' remains > unassigned, they are assigned to the same face as the next > darker assigned keyword, if any, or the next lighter one > otherwise.  This seems to mean that unless the font has an explicit 600 weight, that it should map to the next darkest (bold).. is that correct?

With that patch:  * font-weight: 600 now displays as bold. * fonts that have a wide range of weights display those correctly (example: Gill Sans in the first test case) - that is better than what Safari/Webkit does.
