It's set to some number (4), but since the preprocessor expands it before it can be assigned, you end up with something approximating this:  enum { 3.14159L = 4 };  That isn't right.  I got around it by undefining PI in the file immediately before this, but that isn't the right thing to do either.  Change the name from PI to something other than a commonly used mathematical constant.  Besides, I have no idea what a \"PI\" node is from the name - it's a crappy name or abbreviation.  The errant code is around line 44:  class nsIDOMNode : public nsISupports { public:   // NodeType   enum NodeType {     DOCUMENT             = 1,     ELEMENT              = 2,     ATTRIBUTE            = 3,     PI                   = 4, <<--------------     COMMENT              = 5,     TEXT                 = 6   };    ... }; Updated by   (toshok@netscape.com) on Monday, May 18, 1998 11:38:43 AM PDT Additional Details : vidur?","id":682,"bug_id":293,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Sep 08 16:42:59 EEST 1998","creator":"vidur@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"vidur@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Sep 08 16:42:59 EEST 1998","text":"The name of the enum has been changed to PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION as per the W3C spec.","id":683,"bug_id":293,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Feb 05 16:12:59 EET 1999","creator":"glynn@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"glynn@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Feb 05 16:12:59 EET 1999","text":"qa contact set to gerardok@netscape.com for verify against new code base","id":684,"bug_id":293,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Mar 26 02:58:59 EET 1999","creator":"gerardok@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"gerardok@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Mar 26 02:58:59 EET 1999","text":"Verified on 3/25 source file.","id":685,"bug_id":293,"tags":[]}]}
