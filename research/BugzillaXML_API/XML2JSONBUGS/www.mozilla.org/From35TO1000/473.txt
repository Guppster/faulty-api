NIS passwords used. Netscape release 4.05, linked against libc5.  Netscape refuses to send mail, claiming \".. is out of memory; close some applications blah blah blah\".  cmd/xfe/dialogs.c: fe_DefaultUserInfo() is calling  getpwuid(geteuid) which is giving NULL, as libc5 does not  support NIS (only local passwd entries are returned).  cmd/xfe/xfe.c: FE_UsersRealMailAddress() is caching \"\" as  the user's mail address (eg should be \"jmb\")  lib/libnet/mksmtp.c: net_smtp_send_data_response(...)  is passing (real_name == \"\") to MSG_MakeFullAddress()  which returns NULL, and the next lines dislikes this  and return with MK_OUT_OF_MEMORY set in CE_URL_S.  Yes, I have found a version (RPM) linked against libc6 now, but the error message is definitely wrong for the circumstance.  And it wasn't easy, when the messenger source hasn't been released yet - ie I couldn't build a debug version, I've been grovelling in the disassembly with gdb...
