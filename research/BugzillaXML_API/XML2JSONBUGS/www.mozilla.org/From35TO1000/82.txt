Updated by Marcos Hauer (mhauer@iis.com.br) on Wednesday, April 8, 1998 1:00:00 PM PDT Additional Details : I have found references linking WIDTH and BORDER-WIDTH as a ''shorthand'' variable in the files ns/lib/libstyle/csstab.c and ns/lib/libstyle/css.y, but I''m not sure if it''s related with the error.
