Step one was to add new methods to query for cached values that don't compute them if not found (return PR_FALSE instead). Next, Kipp'll remove references to the old calls (CalcMarginFor and the like) and add static helper functions to do the job when style can't provide enough info. Then the Calc methods will get removed.  This will fix also bugs like #853.  While I was there, I fixed the initial value of border widths (Bug 1051).
