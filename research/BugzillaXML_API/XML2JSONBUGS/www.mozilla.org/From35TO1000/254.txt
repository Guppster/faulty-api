It also changes references to \"EDITOR\" in the build process to \"MOZ_EDITOR\" to avoid problems on unix where EDITOR is commonly set in a user's environment.  The patch is a little large to include here; grab it from:  http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/tor/mozilla/lite.patch Updated by   (tor@cs.brown.edu) on Wednesday, April 29, 1998 11:14:27 PM PDT Additional Details : Patch updated for 19980429 release.

It is the right thing to do, but there are hundreds of #ifdef EDITOR (and the like) scattered throughout the code, so getting all the necessary changes made will probably take a long time.  Providing an individual patch to each owner would probably speed things up, but it'll be a major pain-in-the-ass for you....  I've got a version of config.mk that will support both EDITOR and MOZ_EDITOR for the time being, but will wait for your input before checking it in.","id":538,"bug_id":254,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Aug 28 04:44:59 EEST 1998","creator":"tor@acm.org","author":"tor@acm.org","time":"Fri Aug 28 04:44:59 EEST 1998","text":"I think you may have misunderstood what I'm proposing to do.  The #ifdef EDITORs scattered around the codebase are fine and are taken care of with a -DEDITOR on the compile line.  The thing I'm objecting to is having an EDITOR environment variable set (to \"emacs\", say) screw up the MOZ_LITE build.  I've updated the patch for the current CVS pull (as of 8/28).  This fixes the EDITOR problem mentioned above and fixes the MOZ_LITE build configuration in config.mk and lib/layout/Makefile[.in].  The patch only makes changes to the config directory and a few assorted makefiles -- no actual code changes. Because it modifies the build control variables, the whole patch has to be applied or the tree will break.","id":539,"bug_id":254,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Sep 05 01:32:59 EEST 1998","creator":"briano@bluemartini.com","author":"briano@bluemartini.com","time":"Sat Sep 05 01:32:59 EEST 1998","text":"MOZ_EDITOR is now supported in mozilla/config/config.mk.  EDITOR is *still* there as well, for now.  As soon as all the \"ifdef EDITOR\" lines in the various makefiles are replaced with \"ifdef MOZ_EDITOR\", I'll get rid of the EDITOR (make) macro.  You should send mail to each affected owner with the patch they need to apply.
