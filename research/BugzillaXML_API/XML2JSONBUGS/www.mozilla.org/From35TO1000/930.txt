In the 4.0 spec the type attribute is deprecated, however, we still need to account for default values if and when a CSS script is not present. If you look at the 3.2 spec, the attribute values for the type attribute are clearly defined and in the order that is expected. I have as yet not seen a plan on what the default markers will be and how we will handle nested lists when a CSS script is not present.

The closest language I can find is in section 10.3.1 which is \"normative\" information, not mandatory for spec compliance:  For the UL element, possible values for the type attribute are disc, square, and circle. The default value depends on the level of nesting of the current list.
