If the URL is entered manually, a dialog appear with the error:      Netscape is unable to locate the server:        protocol:     The server does not have a DNS entry.  If the URL is referred from a page, the browser try to access to a URL formed from the base URL of that page and the \"invalid\" URL appended to it (i.e. a link from http://www.server.com/home/insecure.html to https://www.server.com/home/secure.html will be expanded into http://www.server.com/home/https://www.server.com/home/insecure.html)  NOTE: the same happen with Netscape Communicator 4.04 for Linux/i386  IMHO this behavior generates confusion when dealing with invalid URL (i.e. mispelled http) but specially with a valid, but still unsopported, protocol like https. In this case an error dialog with a message like 'unsupported protocol' or 'protocol not yet supported' would be more appropriate and less confusing.","id":3498,"bug_id":888,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Feb 03 16:09:59 EET 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Feb 03 16:09:59 EET 1999","text":"Setting all current Open/Normal to M4.","id":3499,"bug_id":888,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Feb 23 02:07:59 EET 1999","creator":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Feb 23 02:07:59 EET 1999","text":"setting paulmac as QA contact for all gagan's bugs (sorry for the spam)","id":3500,"bug_id":888,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Apr 13 15:35:59 EEST 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Apr 13 15:35:59 EEST 1999","text":"paulmac, is this Linux specific, or all platforms?","id":3501,"bug_id":888,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Apr 13 16:08:59 EEST 1999","creator":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Apr 13 16:08:59 EEST 1999","text":"cross-platform","id":3502,"bug_id":888,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Apr 27 00:04:59 EEST 1999","creator":"gagan@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"gagan@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Apr 27 00:04:59 EEST 1999","text":"Marking till Necko lands...","id":3503,"bug_id":888,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat May 15 02:21:59 EEST 1999","creator":"gagan@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"gagan@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Sat May 15 02:21:59 EEST 1999","text":"Per DP's suggestion marking these till M8.
