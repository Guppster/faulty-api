I just went to take a look at nsFrameFrame.cpp, the frame class for IFRAMEs and  it doesn't look like simply creating this type of frame instead of an object one  and leaving the content the same will work as is done with the object tag and  images. Looks like there is too much reliance on the content. So, I see two ways  of fixing this:  1) [Easy Way] Is to simply change the content node if OBJECT type=text/html to  that of an IFRAME and let nsFrameFrame.cpp do all the work. This seems like a  bit of a hack and I'm not quite sure how the DOM would like us replacing the  author's content with that of deprecated content? I'm not even quite sure the  author and spec would even be effected or notice. Any core layout junkies know?  2) It doesn't look like there is a whole lot of code needed to create a webshell  and docshell subdocuments in nsFrameFrame.cpp. Hooking up the views and view  managers looks most complicated. A few things already stand out in my mind as  needing special attention such as printing and events. Since nsObjectFrame.cpp  is already huge, at least one more class would need to be created. Seems like a  lot of work.  3) [Just thought of this one] Does the spec say anything is wrong with actually  creating a plugin to handle types of text/html? Instead of creating another  frame class, could one create an XPCOM plugin to handle XHTML mime types? How  would this interfear with the DOM? I guess XPConnect could be used for  scripting.

Right now, I see nothing in the code for HandleImage() that would prevent it for working with documents as well. Looks pretty generic. Perhaps I'll just change the name or am I missing something? Is there another place I'm missing where we handle OBJECT-tag images special?  nsContentDLF.cpp seems to be for content-viewer creation and doesn't seem to be what I need.  For the IsSupported[Image|Document] call, what I really need is a service that I can pass a MIME-type and it returns a value indicating this is something we can render internally.   You are right about comparing the file extensions. I found nsIMIMEService::GetTypeFromURI(nsIURI) may work better in both documents and images as (should) return a mime-type for a given URL based on extension parsing. I would also like to use nsIMIMEInfo::GetPreferredAction(action) but either I didn't use it correctly or it was incorrectly returning saveToDisk  instead of handleInternally. Is there another way to do this?  Images using the OBJECT tag do not check the content-type in the header at all and neither will docuemnts for now. I looked into changing this, as per spec, and it ain't easy due to the current way Reflow() works to instatiate a plugin. This last check for mime-type happens deep inside plugin streaming code and it only calls back to the plugin host, which after all, assumes it's going to be a plugin. For that to work for images and documents, we'd have to have some callback to the ObjectFrame, possibly through an nsPluginInstanceOwner, and also destroy any plugin data structures created at that point. Becase that effects both this bug and OBJECT-tag images, perhaps we should open another bug on this specific issue.","id":863430,"bug_id":678,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Aug 09 16:39:13 EEST 2001","creator":"bbaetz@gmail.com","author":"bbaetz@gmail.com","time":"Thu Aug 09 16:39:13 EEST 2001","text":"\"For the IsSupported[Image|Document] call, what I really need is a service that I can pass a MIME-type and it returns a value indicating this is something we can render internally.\"  http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/docshell/base/nsDSURIContentListener.cpp#162  should do what you want.

There was also some discussion of this problem in bug 90753 in regards to Acrobat PDF's. It seems we may need to revise the plug-in specification to facilitate communication of the intrinsic dimensions of the embedded data back to layout.  As we can see in [http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/layout/html/base/src/nsObjectFrame.cpp#627], arbitrary dimensions of 240px by 200px are assigned when an object's intrinsic dimensions cannot be determined, such as when a plug-in is involved. Try the testcase associated with that bug; you'll see the PDF assumes those dimensions. Try assigning the style, \"width: 500px\" to the OBJECT, and you'd expect it to then become 500px by 200px, but you'll be surprised to see both height and width become 500px.
