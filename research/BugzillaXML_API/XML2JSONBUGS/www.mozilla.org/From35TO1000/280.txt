I have vc++ 5.0 professional with the latest service pack, and it has a different version, thus the linking is messed up because uuid[2,3].lib have been consoladated to uuid.lib in ver 5.0.

Updated by Garrett Arch Blythe (blythe@netscape.com) on Tuesday, July 7, 1998 2:58:23 PM PDT Additional Details : Sure, we can do that. Note that _MSC_VER is set manually by you in your environment. You can set it to 1100 if you need to just to avoid linking this. Send a diff to the patches group, and we can take it, otherwise just set your environment to 1100 and avoid the problem.  garrett","id":632,"bug_id":280,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Aug 28 00:31:59 EEST 1998","creator":"terry@mozilla.org","author":"terry@mozilla.org","time":"Fri Aug 28 00:31:59 EEST 1998","text":"*** Bug 160 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***","id":633,"bug_id":280,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Dec 26 00:29:07 EET 2000","creator":"bugzilla@mversen.de","author":"bugzilla@mversen.de","time":"Tue Dec 26 00:29:07 EET 2000","text":"mid-air collision ? / bugzilla cleanup Reopening (current State: resolved and no resolution) ","id":544800,"bug_id":280,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Dec 26 00:29:35 EET 2000","creator":"bugzilla@mversen.de","author":"bugzilla@mversen.de","time":"Tue Dec 26 00:29:35 EET 2000","text":"marking fixed","id":544801,"bug_id":280,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Jun 26 14:21:15 EEST 2001","creator":"bruno.deroulede@carltoninteractive.com","author":"bruno.deroulede@carltoninteractive.com","time":"Tue Jun 26 14:21:15 EEST 2001","text":"The problem is with Flash Ashluecker have added a new function inside QuiZino where the user is told that  their score has been reset because it was over 2 billion but is kept in our  database","id":796429,"bug_id":280,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Jan 13 01:41:52 EET 2003","creator":"brant@gurganus.name","author":"brant@gurganus.name","time":"Mon Jan 13 01:41:52 EET 2003","text":"VERIFIED due to no changes in over a year","id":1707234,"bug_id":280,"tags":[]}]}
