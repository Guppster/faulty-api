Frame.cpp   in DisplayPixmap(..) RDFImage.cpp in RDFDisplayPixmap(..) In both cases the declaration and definition of the functions differ. That is jint is used equivalent to long int, and my compiler throws error. The fix is trivial, and it did compile when I changed the definition to match the declaration. I suppose the error only occurs on 64-bit machines ??","id":1434,"bug_id":519,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Sep 29 07:38:59 EEST 1998","creator":"mcafee@gmail.com","author":"mcafee@gmail.com","time":"Tue Sep 29 07:38:59 EEST 1998","text":"Do you have a patch for this?
