The patches mentioned in bugreport #122 make it work on some, but not all architectures that NetBSD runs on. The following patch fixes this, and can be applied on a source tree that has the patches in report #122 already applied: ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/fvdl/mozilla/diff.002 Updated by Frank van der Linden (frank@wins.uva.nl) on Sunday, May 24, 1998 4:47:35 PM PDT Additional Details : The updated changes for the 1998-04-29 version can be found in ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/ftp/pub/NetBSD/misc/fvdl/mozilla/diff-19980429.001  This patch combines the patch in report #122 with the one for this report, and updates it for the 1998-04-29 version.  There weren't many changes; just a few conflicts with changes made in the main source tree were resolved. Updated by Brian Ostrom (briano@netscape.com) on Monday, July 13, 1998 3:49:20 PM PDT Additional Details : Well, that worked well....  I changed the assigned-to field and added a comment, and submitted it..., and only the assigned-to entry got updated.  Swell.  Anyway, Wan-Teh, I reassigned this to you because most of the remaining changes are in NSPR.  The most recent diff file is in:  ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/fvdl/mozilla/ Updated by Wan-Teh Chang (wtc@netscape.com) on Monday, July 13, 1998 3:54:09 PM PDT Additional Details : OK.  Accepted the bug.  Chris Toshok also gave me some NetBSD files on June 30, 1998.  Are we under a code freeze right now? Updated by Wan-Teh Chang (wtc@netscape.com) on Monday, July 13, 1998 5:50:00 PM PDT Additional Details : I merged into my private tree the two files Chris Toshok gave me and also diff-19980408.001, diff-19980408.002, diff-19980429.001, and diff-19980603.001 in ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/fvdl/mozilla/.  I will check it in when I find out whether there is a code freeze. Updated by Wan-Teh Chang (wtc@netscape.com) on Friday, July 17, 1998 4:33:00 PM PDT Additional Details : I just checked in the NetBSD port of NSPR.  Frank, after you verify that Mozilla builds on NetBSD, let us know so that we can close this bug. Updated by Frank van der Linden (frank@wins.uva.nl) on Tuesday, August 4, 1998 12:04:09 PM PDT Additional Details : The remainder of the patches (i.e. the ones that are left now that the nsprpub part has been integrated) for the 1998-07-28 release can be found in ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/fvdl/mozilla/diff-19980728.001  This diff does contain 2 additions to files that already were patched; one because the name of a jmpbuf index was changed in the arm32 specific files of NetBSD, and another that makes the compile always use -fPIC.","id":568,"bug_id":263,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Nov 16 23:50:59 EET 1998","creator":"wtc@google.com","author":"wtc@google.com","time":"Mon Nov 16 23:50:59 EET 1998","text":"This bug has been fixed (see also bug 122).","id":569,"bug_id":263,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Nov 16 23:51:59 EET 1998","creator":"wtc@google.com","author":"wtc@google.com","time":"Mon Nov 16 23:51:59 EET 1998","text":"Closed the bug.","id":570,"bug_id":263,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Apr 27 17:59:59 EEST 1999","creator":"terry@mozilla.org","author":"terry@mozilla.org","time":"Tue Apr 27 17:59:59 EEST 1999","text":"NSPR now has its own Bugzilla product.
