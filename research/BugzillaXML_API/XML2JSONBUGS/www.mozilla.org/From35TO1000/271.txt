The proxy setting is probably being ignored.  Without looking at the code, I suspect it's fetching the info directly, rather than going through the standard NetLib method.  Both the Manual Proxy setting and the autoproxy.pac files are ignored.  There are other odd things happening around the proxy settings, but this is quite reproducible. Updated by   (meltsner@hotmail.com) on Wednesday, May 6, 1998 6:26:44 AM PDT Additional Details : It still happens with 4-29 release.  I suspect it's that the default NavCenter RDF file is fetched without looking at the proxy settings, or it could be the other problem I've noticed, which is that frequently the proxy settings don't seem to be read upon startup -- you have to change them back and forth to enable application proxy access.","id":591,"bug_id":271,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Sep 08 21:01:59 EEST 1998","creator":"gagan@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"gagan@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Sep 08 21:01:59 EEST 1998","text":"Sounds similar.  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 248 ***","id":592,"bug_id":271,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Mar 04 17:15:59 EET 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Thu Mar 04 17:15:59 EET 1999","text":"Marking Verified/Duplicate.","id":593,"bug_id":271,"tags":[]}]}
