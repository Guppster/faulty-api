The variable \"spinning_wildly\" is trigging an assertion failed when spinning_wildly > 12. I have done some debugging here and found that a value of 30 is too little. This is not a serious bug though. Btw, we need an IRIX 6.4 OS version entry here.

I also tracked it down to the 'spinning wildly' stuff, but haven't had the chance to investigate exactly why it happens.  I don't think I'm seeing any user-visible misbehavior because of it.  Note that there are some comments in this area of mozilla.c that indicate that some Xt libraries are known to be broken in some way that is probably related to this, but I'm a little unclear on what exactly the problem is.  DG/UX's X is based on a pretty old rev-- R4, I think (I'll have to double check).  Could the same be true of Irix?","id":41,"bug_id":71,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Sep 08 17:50:59 EEST 1998","creator":"akkzilla@shallowsky.com","author":"akkzilla@shallowsky.com","time":"Tue Sep 08 17:50:59 EEST 1998","text":"I use IRIX 6.3 but haven't seen this recently.

In fact, I'm seeing it right now, on this very page.  BTW, I checked, and I was wrong, DG/UX is currently at X11R5, not R4.  Well, at least the X server is, I might have to delve a little deeper and make sure that the libXt version matches the server version.","id":44,"bug_id":71,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Sep 08 23:01:59 EEST 1998","creator":"akkzilla@shallowsky.com","author":"akkzilla@shallowsky.com","time":"Tue Sep 08 23:01:59 EEST 1998","text":"If you're seeing it that often, I can only guess that it is indeed a change from 6.3 to 6.4, since I'm not seeing it in 6.3 (I'm using Mozilla on 6.3 to write this). Have you checked to see how big spinning_wildly actually gets?  Like, is this something where maybe just changing it from 12 to 15 might help?  Looks like whoever put spinning_wildly in in the first place was just guessing the high-end numbers based on what was observed, and tuning them to go along with nspr or other variables ...","id":45,"bug_id":71,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Sep 09 13:19:59 EEST 1998","creator":"fraioli@dg-rtp.dg.com","author":"fraioli@dg-rtp.dg.com","time":"Wed Sep 09 13:19:59 EEST 1998","text":"I stuck some printfs in to see what spinning_wildly was doing when the assertion failed, and the only values I've seen come out of it are 12 and 13.  So yeah, bumping the assertion check up to 15 would stop it from failing, though it leaves me at least with no better understanding of what's actually happening here.  I think I'll try building a more recent set of X libs (particularly Xt) and linking against that.  If that gets spinning_wildly down, we can just chalk it up to a bad Xt library, and then bumping the assertion check up to 15 is fine by me.","id":46,"bug_id":71,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Sep 22 18:11:59 EEST 1998","creator":"akkzilla@shallowsky.com","author":"akkzilla@shallowsky.com","time":"Tue Sep 22 18:11:59 EEST 1998","text":"Have you had a chance to try the new Xt library?

With the system R5 libraries, it's still not going over 13.  If you want to just increase the limit, that's ok by me.
