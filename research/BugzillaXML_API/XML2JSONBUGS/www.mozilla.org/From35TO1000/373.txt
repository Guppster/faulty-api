Handing over to layout expert, as crash happens in LO_SelectAll.","id":936,"bug_id":373,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Sep 07 17:49:59 EEST 1998","creator":"nisheeth_mozilla@yahoo.com","author":"nisheeth_mozilla@yahoo.com","time":"Mon Sep 07 17:49:59 EEST 1998","text":"This bug is fixed in the latest mozilla builds.
