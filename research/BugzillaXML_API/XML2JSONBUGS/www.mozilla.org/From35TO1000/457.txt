The field containing where the downloaded file will be stored is not visible.","id":1204,"bug_id":457,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Sep 29 07:33:59 EEST 1998","creator":"mcafee@gmail.com","author":"mcafee@gmail.com","time":"Tue Sep 29 07:33:59 EEST 1998","text":"yeah I've noticed this too.","id":1205,"bug_id":457,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Jan 05 19:28:59 EET 1999","creator":"mcafee@gmail.com","author":"mcafee@gmail.com","time":"Tue Jan 05 19:28:59 EET 1999","text":"We're rewriting the client, I think this is a mozilla-classic bug.","id":1206,"bug_id":457,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Jan 13 01:42:34 EET 2003","creator":"brant@gurganus.name","author":"brant@gurganus.name","time":"Mon Jan 13 01:42:34 EET 2003","text":"VERIFIED due to no changes in over a year","id":1707260,"bug_id":457,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Jan 13 20:10:08 EET 2003","creator":"mcafee@gmail.com","author":"mcafee@gmail.com","time":"Mon Jan 13 20:10:08 EET 2003","text":"No, let's verify that we won't fix this, not \"this has not changed in a year\".
