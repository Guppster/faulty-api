Without this facility, it meant that I've duplicate-reported some bugs by mistake, without realising they'd already been reported.  To save on CPU cycles, perhaps only the Summary line needs to be searched, rather than the Description body ?  Also, when submitting a bug, there appears to be no mechanism to avoid (or at least warning about the possibility of) duplicate bug reports. Perhaps a keyword system or something would have to be used - if your bug report matches keywords, list those matching bug reports (allowing the user to check them out) as a warning before accepting a new bug report. Or maybe you folks could figure something out better than this, I dunno  BTW, why are there no \"Bugzilla components\" ? I'm forced to choose a component when reporting this bug, but they all look like Mozilla components to me !","id":1531,"bug_id":538,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Aug 27 17:23:59 EEST 1998","creator":"terry@mozilla.org","author":"terry@mozilla.org","time":"Thu Aug 27 17:23:59 EEST 1998","text":"OK, fixed.
