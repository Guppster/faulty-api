This is a major bug for developers, because it is absolutely necessary to nest elements/layers for creating certain D-HTML content. (note that you can nest cssp elements in IE without it breaking like it does in dogbert.)  See the sample URL. Notice that the first nest of elements works fine, but then the following nests of the cssp layers somehow loose their cssp properties or something...  Please fix this!  If you have any questions, let me know.  -Gary","id":2477,"bug_id":716,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu May 07 07:07:59 EEST 1998","creator":"nisheeth_mozilla@yahoo.com","author":"nisheeth_mozilla@yahoo.com","time":"Thu May 07 07:07:59 EEST 1998","text":"Setting target fix to 5.0 and assigning this to djw who is working on CSS stability.","id":2478,"bug_id":716,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Jul 22 18:12:59 EEST 1998","creator":"don@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"don@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Jul 22 18:12:59 EEST 1998","text":"Downgrading priotity to P1.","id":2479,"bug_id":716,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Aug 05 00:24:59 EEST 1998","creator":"toshok@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"toshok@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Aug 05 00:24:59 EEST 1998","text":"Reassigning to eric pollmann","id":2480,"bug_id":716,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Sep 02 01:22:59 EEST 1998","creator":"pollmann@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"pollmann@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Sep 02 01:22:59 EEST 1998","text":"The problem seems to be:  The document.ids hashtable gets created twice.
