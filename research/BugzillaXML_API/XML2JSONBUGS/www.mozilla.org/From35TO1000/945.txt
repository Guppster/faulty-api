AFAIK, there are two requirements for label in the HTML 4.0 specs:  1. click on the label, the check box toggles. this works. 2. click on the label, and it gets a dashed border, or some other visual    indication that it has the focus. this is not apparent as of the    09.december.1998 seamonkey build.  i'm prepared to mark this bug verified fixed if you guys don't think #2 is important, i think it is important to eventually fix.  should this be re-opened?","id":3872,"bug_id":945,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Dec 10 23:57:59 EET 1998","creator":"angus@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"angus@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Thu Dec 10 23:57:59 EET 1998","text":"This bug should be fixed because labels work.  A separate bug should be opened, essentially stating that form elements with focus need to get a dotted \"outline\" (see CSS2 spec for definition of \"outline\").
