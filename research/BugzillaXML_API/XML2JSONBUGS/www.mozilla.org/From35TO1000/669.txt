The page looks OK on Communicator 4.5 PR1 but with Raptor (8/12 mid-day build) the image laps over the text.  The problem appears to be with the content being inside <UL>...<\/UL> tags (albeit not part of a <LI>...<\/LI> list item); if the <UL> and <\/UL> tags are removed then the page lays out properly in Raptor (identical to 4.5).  The original page (from which the example above was extracted) is at <http://www.menk.com/dod_license/>.  Note that the page was created and modified exclusively using Composer, and presumably Composer inserted the LI-less UL tags at some point for reasons of its own.","id":2206,"bug_id":669,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Dec 01 23:53:59 EET 1998","creator":"ernie@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"ernie@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Dec 01 23:53:59 EET 1998","text":"11/30 build on NT/win98. image does not overlap text anymore.  verified fixed.","id":2207,"bug_id":669,"tags":[]}]}
