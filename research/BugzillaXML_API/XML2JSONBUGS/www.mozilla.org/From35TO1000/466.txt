This bug is deals with text and attribute changing when a document is displayed on a screen.  From what I have seen, when Netscape loads and displays documents on the screen, it sets up a \"Font Stack\" to do its attribute changing.  Say you change the current text in a document to bold; Netscape pushes the current font onto a stack and uses that font + bold for the new font.  The problem comes when you have a line like the following.  text <B> text <I> text <\/B> text <\/I> text  When the <\/B> tag appears, the font stack is popped, and a previous font is retrieved.  However, this previous font does not have bold turned off, but rather has italics turned off!  If you are following me, take it one step further. Try putting a <FONT COLOR=\"#mycolor\"> in the above html line and modifying it such that a different attribute is turned off before the color is.  Another question arises: \"who would do such a thing as overlap font attributes?\".  Well....me!  I would love to hear some input from mozilla developers, especially reasons *why* this \"Font Stack\" was implemented into the browser. (Am I missing something?  Is it faster than other techniques for formatting and displaying a doc? Easier?)  Jared Momose.
