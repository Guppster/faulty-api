Thanks Updated by Wan-Teh Chang (wtc@netscape.com) on Monday, June 8, 1998 6:26:53 PM PDT Additional Details : Can you tell me the version number of your Linux kernel? I am assuming you are using Alpha Linux? Can you also email me the files /usr/include/jmp_buf.h and /usr/include/alpha/jmp_buf.h?  I need to know how 'sigjmpbuf' is defined on your system. Updated by Wan-Teh Chang (wtc@netscape.com) on Tuesday, June 16, 1998 8:35:40 PM PDT Additional Details : Accepted the bug.  Still don't have time to look at the header files you sent me.  Sorry :-) Updated by Wan-Teh Chang (wtc@netscape.com) on Monday, July 13, 1998 11:44:44 AM PDT Additional Details : Bernd Retzlaff supplied the following info:     The machine is running RedHat Linux 4.1 for     Alpha (kernel 2.0.30).      The type __jmp_buf is defined as follows:     typedef struct       {         ...         long int *__pc, *__fp, *__sp;         ...       } __jmp_buf[1];  Bernd, can you send me the /usr/include/features.h file on your machine, so that I can determine the major and minor version numbers of your libc?  On the RedHat 5.0 Linux for alpha machine we have here, its /usr/include/features.h defines the following macros:     #define __GNU_LIBRARY__ 6     #define __GLIBC__ 2     #define __GLIBC_MINOR__ 0  I hope that we can programmatically distinguish your libc from the libc on our machine by testing these macros. If this doesn't work, I will teach you how to manually edit /mozilla/nsprpub/pr/include/md/_linux.h for your system.","id":1056,"bug_id":429,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Feb 03 16:07:59 EET 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Feb 03 16:07:59 EET 1999","text":"Setting all current Open/Normal to M4.","id":1057,"bug_id":429,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Mar 06 07:09:59 EET 1999","creator":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Sat Mar 06 07:09:59 EET 1999","text":"per leger, assigning QA contacts to all open bugs without QA contacts according to list at http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Browser","id":1058,"bug_id":429,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Apr 08 23:30:59 EEST 1999","creator":"chofmann@gmail.com","author":"chofmann@gmail.com","time":"Thu Apr 08 23:30:59 EEST 1999","text":"moving to m6","id":1059,"bug_id":429,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Apr 09 03:46:59 EEST 1999","creator":"wtc@google.com","author":"wtc@google.com","time":"Fri Apr 09 03:46:59 EEST 1999","text":"Marked the bug resolved-wontfix.
