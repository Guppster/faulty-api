That means we end up doing 430 incremental reflows and since the block/inline code isn't optimized yet that means a whole heck of a lot of work.  Rick, this can't be fixed by Monday. It's not a very big problem either because it's not common to see pages with so many images without width/height tags  A related problem which we need to address at some point is that because there are only five or so unique images we get the size info quickly and then generate 430 reflow commands which we then continually process until we're finished. That's why it appears like we're hung.","id":4108,"bug_id":985,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sun Nov 22 03:55:59 EET 1998","creator":"troy@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"troy@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Sun Nov 22 03:55:59 EET 1998","text":"*** Bug 1489 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***","id":4109,"bug_id":985,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Dec 11 17:24:59 EET 1998","creator":"kipp@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"kipp@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Dec 11 17:24:59 EET 1998","text":"I updated the title to reflect the real problem.
