This is with an NGLayout build as of 10 September 1998.  The HTML to cause this bug (also at the referenced URL)is surprisingly simple:  <TABLE>  <TR> <TD ROWSPAN=2>  <TABLE> <TR><TD><A HREF=\"01.html\">01<\/A><\/TD><\/TR> <TR><TD><A HREF=\"02.html\">02<\/A><\/TD><\/TR> <\/TABLE>  <\/TD> <\/TR>  <TR><TD>03<\/TD><\/TR>  <\/TABLE>  If either the ROWSPAN or the last table row is removed (\"03\") then the problem goes away.

Instead of simply checking it's childrens' rects to see if they contain the event point, it asks them nsTableRowFrame::Contains(event point).  The row checks its own bounds, and failing that test it asks its children.  This can be used as a template for other container frames that have children outside their own bounding rect.  We could move Contains() up in the frame class hierarchy and make it a more general purpose mechanism.  Interestingly, even though links in row-spanned cells now work, the cursor doesn't change to a hand the way it should.  So I'm leaving the bug open, changing the summary slightly, and leaving it assigned to joki.
