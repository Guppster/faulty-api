There seems to be a problem with the mcom_db.h include file.  Not sure, but I think there are some unmatched \"endif\".  The result of which is that the:       #include <sys/machine.h> statement is not activated.  Which result in the undefined references.  Question:   Is there a way to get the \"gmake -ek\" command to use the GNU gcc, g++, c++ compliers that are in my /usr/local/bin directory?  Everytime I executed gmake -ek command I ended up using AIX''s \"c\" compiler. I do not have a \"c++\" compiler from IBM.  The only \"c++\" compiler I have is the GNU one which resides in the /usr/local/bin directory.","id":250,"bug_id":142,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Aug 28 00:17:59 EEST 1998","creator":"terry@mozilla.org","author":"terry@mozilla.org","time":"Fri Aug 28 00:17:59 EEST 1998","text":"*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 141 ***","id":251,"bug_id":142,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Mar 04 17:11:59 EET 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Thu Mar 04 17:11:59 EET 1999","text":"Marking Verified.","id":252,"bug_id":142,"tags":[]}]}
