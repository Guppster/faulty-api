After installing netscape I noticed that netscape stores the specific user information under the LOCAL_MACHINE key in the registry. Since only the CURRENT_USER key gets saved per user this leads to some problems. For example: user x saves the profile under U:\\profiles u: being the mounted user-directory from the server. Now he logs out and another user starts netscape. Since he doesnt have u:\\profiles on his u: drive netscpae asks him to create a profile. He does it..and everything works. But this way you get a pretty large number of profiles on one machine and the worst part is, when the user goes to another machine he has to do it again.  A workaround is to tell the users to create a profile with a special name \"default\" and store it under u:\\netscape. So netscape looks for it on the network drive and finds it. But that way it is impossible for a user to have more than one profile for himself.","id":1158,"bug_id":452,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Sep 12 00:01:59 EEST 1998","creator":"dveditz@mozilla.com","author":"dveditz@mozilla.com","time":"Sat Sep 12 00:01:59 EEST 1998","text":"I don't think this is a mozilla bug, but assigning to Edwin for a look.
