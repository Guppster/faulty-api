Unfortunately it does this through js_GC(), rather than JS_GC(), so nothing actually gets garbage collected.  A discussion about this went on in mozilla.general. See article <353FBFE6.CA026B4C@netscape.com> and the subsequent reply for details of the performance impacts of the fix (or URL  http://www.acorn.com/~ahodgkin/javascript/js_speed.html  if you don't want to dig out the news articles). Updated by Mike McCabe (mccabe@netscape.com) on Tuesday, May 26, 1998 10:53:37 PM PDT Additional Details : Looks like this was fixed a while ago.  I've confirmed that JS_MaybeGC in jsapi.c calls JS_GC() rather than js_GC().
