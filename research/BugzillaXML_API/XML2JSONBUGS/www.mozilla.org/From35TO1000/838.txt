All previous Mozilla releases built fine with \"CC\", so there's   a lot of \"g++-isms\" been added with the 4th Sept release I suspect.  * HP's ANSI C++ (\"aCC\" command) can actually build Mozilla, but it core dumps   during intiialisation. I didn't really fancy debugging this, so I concentrated   on installing the latest gcc/libstdc++ and using that to build Mozilla   instead.  * gcc 2.8.1/libstdc++ 2.8.1.1 both builds Mozilla and manages to run Mozilla   on HP-UX 10.20, but there's serious problems with background tiling - loads   of graphical corruption on any pages with background tiles.  So the advice is to stick with gcc/g++ for building Mozilla on HP-UX - all other compilers don't work. Even gcc/g++ produces that background tile problem though. Has anyone at Netscape actually managed to build the 4th Sept 98 Mozilla at all and get it to work sensibly ?  BTW, there's a major omission in the build config for Mozilla - a \"mid-way\" build - i.e. one without optimisation *or* debugging. I ended up having to hack around in 3 or 4 places to get rid of the -O's (whilst keeping BUILD_OPT defined). I did this to rule out optimisation bugs in gcc/g++ (I ruled them out: same problem with a non-optimised build).","id":3217,"bug_id":838,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Sep 29 00:48:59 EEST 1998","creator":"briano@bluemartini.com","author":"briano@bluemartini.com","time":"Tue Sep 29 00:48:59 EEST 1998","text":"I am working on this.
