This is increadibly annoying, and is downright dangerous. There have been several instances when I've tried to click on a link the instant before a Java applet switched to another navigator window, where my click resulted in a completely different effect. I have to turn Java off, because when I open 5-10 news sites, they visibly 'flicker' as the focus jumps from one window to another.","id":1504,"bug_id":533,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Oct 26 16:26:59 EET 1998","creator":"blythe@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"blythe@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Mon Oct 26 16:26:59 EET 1998","text":"Handing over to more appropriate person.","id":1505,"bug_id":533,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Oct 26 19:06:59 EET 1998","creator":"warrensomebody@gmail.com","author":"warrensomebody@gmail.com","time":"Mon Oct 26 19:06:59 EET 1998","text":"This is not a mozilla bug.
