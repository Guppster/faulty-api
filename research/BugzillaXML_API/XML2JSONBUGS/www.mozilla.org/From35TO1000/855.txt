The image http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~abell/sowanim.gif is not being re-displayed properly after being obscured by another window. On Win95 with 4.x browser the space where the image was still contains the same bits as the window that obscured it. Eventually on win95 netscape will crash after being manipulated a bit.  With mozilla on Linux (redhat 5.0, 2.0.35) the redrawn image is overwritten by some kind of noise pattern. If do \"view image\" in linux a corrupted image shows up and i get a \"Mozilla is out of memory\" warning (I have 128mb ram and not much else running).  Since sulaco.htm has a background image the linux build has the bug 514 problem but it seems to act a lot differently than i've seen with other pages. The left half of the screen is mostly ok but the right half either has no image or sometimes shows the bits from the previous page. The background image problem isn't as bad when the browser is first loaded but if I run it for a while until i've stumbled across a few asserts then the background gets pretty messed up. The page has 2 animated gifs other than the broken cow image. The images are centered. At the moment on my screen, areas to the left of them seem to have the background image applied correctly. Everything to the right of the left edge of the animations has a plain black background except the space directly to the right of the image. So far in this session i've had an assert at line 179 of xfe.c and in a previous with a more messed up background I also had an assert at line 953 of Browserframe.cpp.  I last updated from cvs on sept 20.","id":3302,"bug_id":855,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Sep 21 19:38:59 EEST 1998","creator":"pnunn@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"pnunn@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Mon Sep 21 19:38:59 EEST 1998","text":"The animated image has a 200x200 dimens in the header. The first frame is 200x200 but subsequent frames are 266x200.  The browser notices the larger allocation size needed and exits with an error.  If the image's header specified a size that would accomodate the largest frame size in the image (like 266x200) the image would display properly.  Later I'd like to change this behavior to one that tries to reallocate to display the image.
