Your handling of a SPAN within an element with additional line-height seems incorrect.  I'm 95% sure that the line-height is outside of the inline block model.  Also, I don't think the way you are handling line height is consistent with the 1/2 leading above, 1/2 leading below model.  (I never quite understood what that implied for the beginning and the end of the paragraph, either.  You may want to ask H&kon about that, unless it's clear to you from the spec.)","id":1795,"bug_id":585,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Jan 29 15:01:59 EET 1999","creator":"dbaron@dbaron.org","author":"dbaron@dbaron.org","time":"Fri Jan 29 15:01:59 EET 1999","text":"Ignore my previous comments and see what I wrote on bug 1990.","id":1796,"bug_id":585,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Feb 03 16:08:59 EET 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Feb 03 16:08:59 EET 1999","text":"Setting all current Open/Normal to M4.","id":1797,"bug_id":585,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Feb 23 19:42:59 EET 1999","creator":"kipp@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"kipp@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Feb 23 19:42:59 EET 1999","text":"This test now works as desired; the line-height property when applied to the span with color now properly surrounds it with half-leading.","id":1798,"bug_id":585,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Feb 24 20:05:59 EET 1999","creator":"dbaron@dbaron.org","author":"dbaron@dbaron.org","time":"Wed Feb 24 20:05:59 EET 1999","text":"All the problems herein described are verified fixed.
