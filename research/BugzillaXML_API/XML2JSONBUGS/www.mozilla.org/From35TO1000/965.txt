Currently, we display the red border, but we disregard the \"border=2\" stuff that should be applied to TD's.  Seperately, the border on TD elements is an inconsistent width.

I believe the current behavior is correct.  I don't know what's going on with the TD borders.  That requires a little investigation.  For the rest of the bug report, I think it boils down to a style/attribute resolution conflict.

Other values of border imply frame=\"border\" and, unless otherwise specified, rules=\"all\". The value \"border\" in the start tag of the TABLE element should be interpreted as the value of the frame attribute. It implies rules=\"all\" and some default (non-zero) value for the border attribute.  See http://www.w3.org/TR/html40/struct/tables.html#h-11.3.1 .  These rules have nothing to do with CSS - if CSS gives a border for a table, it's a border for a table.  So the answer to both your questions is yes, since in both cases the CSS style attribute gives a border for the cell.  These are of course overridden by any author CSS, but that's another bug.  So the correct procedure should be something like this:  * If a table has a border attribute, set the frame and rules attributes as described above.  * then map the value of the border attribute to border-width on the table.  * If the table has rules=all (should you require frame=border too??), then set border-collapse to separate  * Map the frame attribute to the border-style on the four sides of the table:    + border -> outset on all sides    + others can map to either combinations of solid/none or outset/none  * Map the rules attribute to the border style of certain elements within the table:    + all -> inset on cells    + groups -> solid on top and bottom of rowgroups (thead, tbody, tfoot)    + rows -> solid on top and bottom of tr elements    + cols -> solid on sides of col elements    + none -> either 1) do nothing or 2) hidden on cells  * Then cascade all of the above attribute to style mappings in with all the other CSS rules that apply so that they come after all UA and user rules and before all author rules.","id":4018,"bug_id":965,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Aug 31 20:14:59 EEST 1999","creator":"dbaron@dbaron.org","author":"dbaron@dbaron.org","time":"Tue Aug 31 20:14:59 EEST 1999","text":"You should also map border-collapse to separate when rules=none (largely for backwards compatibility).  rules=none and rules=all cover all of the backwards compatibility cases, I think, so you're safe ignoring cellspacing for all the other values and using the collapsing border model.","id":4019,"bug_id":965,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Aug 31 20:20:59 EEST 1999","creator":"dbaron@dbaron.org","author":"dbaron@dbaron.org","time":"Tue Aug 31 20:20:59 EEST 1999","text":"BTW, all the other values of the rules attribute should explicitly map to border-collapse: collapse because:  * Bug 9191 isn't fixed yet.  * It should override user stylesheets.","id":4020,"bug_id":965,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Aug 31 20:29:59 EEST 1999","creator":"dbaron@dbaron.org","author":"dbaron@dbaron.org","time":"Tue Aug 31 20:29:59 EEST 1999","text":"OK... another comment :-) :  I think the above attribute mapping would mean the only table border rules you would need in ua.css for backwards compatibility would be:  table[frame=border], table[rules=all] td {   border-width: 1px; }  (assuming that the attribute-switching described in HTML 4.0 11.3.1 is reflected in the content model, which I think it should be)","id":4021,"bug_id":965,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Sep 02 02:43:59 EEST 1999","creator":"karnaze@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"karnaze@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Thu Sep 02 02:43:59 EEST 1999","text":"Fixed with latest checkin.","id":4022,"bug_id":965,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Thu Sep 16 18:24:59 EEST 1999","creator":"christinehoff4@aol.com","author":"christinehoff4@aol.com","time":"Thu Sep 16 18:24:59 EEST 1999","text":"Using 9/15 Apprunner with peterl test casefro 8/6, verified bug fixed.","id":4023,"bug_id":965,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Oct 20 13:55:36 EEST 2003","creator":"mbelicek@email.cz","author":"mbelicek@email.cz","time":"Mon Oct 20 13:55:36 EEST 2003","text":"Bug is fixed when using \"border:thin solid\", but not for numbered values i.e. \"border:1pt solid\".
