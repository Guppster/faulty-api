In Tk they make a Window out of the menu, I'm assuming in Motif 2.0 they do the same. When you use that menu item (from the bookmarks menu) it makes mozilla segfault. I've also noticed other problems with the pulldown menus using Motif 2.0 -- I haven't been able to replicate them as of yet, expect another report in the next few days when I get more time to play with it.  I have also noticed Motif 1.2.4 doesn't have this item. I'm assuming that this is the reason it hasnt been caught up until now. It would be nice to get Mozilla up an running fully with Motif 2.0 (I really like the pulldown selection boxes w/scrollbars!)
