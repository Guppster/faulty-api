FrameList menu display titles of those pages in Compound text encoding. This is always the case in Communicator/Navigator up to 4.05. In Mozilla (19980331), it''s not consistently the case. For some pages, Frame List menu displays the title correctly while for other pages, Frame List menu displays the title in Compound text encoding. ns/cmd/xfe/src/FrameListmenu.cpp gets the title of the frame using XFE_Frame->getTitle().(defined in Frame.cpp). The way it returns the title of the frame is inconsistent. Sometimes, it returns it in locale-dependent encoding and othertimes it returns it in Compound Text encoding of Xlib. In the former case, a subsequent call to convert locale-dependent encoding to Compound String of Motif leads to the correct result while in the latter case, it doesn''t. Updated by Ramiro Estrugo (ramiro@netscape.com) on Friday, April 24, 1998 9:29:47 PM PDT Additional Details : Assigned to ramiro@netscape.com  I think we can fix this by not using XFE_Frame::getTitle() which as you indicate seems to be flaky.  Instead we can store the title when the back end calls XFE_SetDocTitle() and used that stored string in the frame.  So that when XFE_FrameListMenu iterates through the frames, it gets what the backend thinks should be the right thing for the title.  This we know will work, since titles for documents are not broken in the BE as far as we can tell.","id":360,"bug_id":193,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Sep 08 10:44:59 EEST 1998","creator":"ramiro@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"ramiro@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Sep 08 10:44:59 EEST 1998","text":"Marking assigned.","id":361,"bug_id":193,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Jan 06 01:15:59 EET 1999","creator":"ramiro@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"ramiro@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Jan 06 01:15:59 EET 1999","text":"old code base.  marking wontix.","id":362,"bug_id":193,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Feb 26 20:58:59 EET 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Feb 26 20:58:59 EET 1999","text":"Marking Verified/Won't Fix","id":363,"bug_id":193,"tags":[]}]}
