Operating system MAC     (ie. iMac) Browsers  ALL Netscape(3,4)   (works perfectly on Mac IE4)  On a Netscape / Mac, Http uploads are destroying files with both a data fork and resource fork. Files like a 120k simpletext application get sent up as 0K  On IE4 / Mac everything is kept in tact. I think somehow they use MacBinary to their advantage.  I would rather have myusers use Netscape. How do we go about getting a patch. I have researched this extensively with no luck, (except learning it is a Netscape error)   Thanks  Frank LLosa","id":3823,"bug_id":937,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Sep 30 17:34:59 EEST 1998","creator":"sdagley@mac.com","author":"sdagley@mac.com","time":"Wed Sep 30 17:34:59 EEST 1998","text":"Changed to an enhancment request as the release notes specifically state that MacBinary encoding is not performed for file uploads.
