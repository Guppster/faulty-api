Mozilla has a very nice feature (I think it's new...) where it saves the username and password for login sites.  It works well, but one of the confirmation dialogs is worded in a confusing manner:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Confirmation Dialog   Do you want to save the username and password contained on this form?    [X] If not, do you want to remember this decision?        [ OK ]  [ Cancel ] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  It's very unclear what's going on here.  I have no idea what the check box is supposed to do.  If I understand the purpose of this dialog box, might something like this be clearer:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Confirmation Dialog   Do you want to save the username and password for this form?    [ ] Do not ask when viewing this page in the future.        [ OK ]  [ Cancel ] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  or even:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Confirmation Dialog   Do you want to save the username and password for this form?

So once he gives a negative answer we will automatically remember it for that site.  This avoids the confusing checkbox and simplifies the user's experience.  This might have been a bad decision and perhaps we should resurect the checkbox with the wording \"Never save for this site\".  This is what is currently done for wallet.  Still a bit confusing because if the checkbox is checked and he presses OK we ignore the checkbox since it's a meaningless combination (how could he say \"never save for this site\" but at the same time be saying \"save it this time\"). If you think we should resurect the checkbox (at the very least it will be consistent with wallet), then reopen this bug report.  The change in the code is trivial.","id":3633,"bug_id":909,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Jun 25 17:12:59 EEST 1999","creator":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Jun 25 17:12:59 EEST 1999","text":"I think a simple user experience is better, probably.
