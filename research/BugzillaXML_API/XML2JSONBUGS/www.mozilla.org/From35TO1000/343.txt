Updated by   (sjm@nwc.dk) on Saturday, May 9, 1998 2:35:41 AM PDT Additional Details : Actually, its \"REGOFF\" that causes the problem. If \"REGOFF\" is substituted with something else it compiles OK. Updated by   (sjm@nwc.dk) on Saturday, May 9, 1998 2:42:12 AM PDT Additional Details : Platform=i586-pc-solaris2.6   (Solaris 2.6_X86) GCC 2.8.1 Updated by   (sjm@nwc.dk) on Tuesday, May 12, 1998 12:22:55 AM PDT Additional Details : It is /usr/include/sys/reg.h on a Solaris2.6_X86 platform that contains \"#define REGOFF MINFRAME\". This define breaks reg.h and reg.c Updated by   (sjm@nwc.dk) on Sunday, May 24, 1998 12:42:09 AM PDT Additional Details : This bug only applies to SunOS5.6_x86. There is a patch for this problem.
