I think you should be able to click anywhere on the line. Updated by Steve Lamm (slamm@netscape.com) on Friday, May 8, 1998 5:34:11 PM PDT Additional Details : I thought that was a problem too.  This should not be an issue when we switch to icons.  However, I will pass this along to ramiro since he is working on that widget.","id":467,"bug_id":238,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Sep 08 10:37:59 EEST 1998","creator":"ramiro@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"ramiro@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Sep 08 10:37:59 EEST 1998","text":"Was this the selector bar ?
