This time in jsapi.c, line 829. (I'm guessing this is part of the javascript module.)  I had about 8 windows open when the crash occurred. I'd been looking at BBS CGI scripts, and had just closed a window.  This occurred on Win95 running Moz-980904.  Cause: ------ The debugger indicates that the exception was somewhere inside of:  JS_PUBLIC_API(void) JS_GC(JSContext *cx) {     if (!cx->fp)  PR_FinishArenaPool(&cx->stackPool);  /* >> */   PR_FinishArenaPool(&cx->codePool);     PR_FinishArenaPool(&cx->tempPool);     js_ForceGC(cx); }  The debugger only traces into PR_FinishArenaPool in the dissassembly window, which I can't follow.  So I can't find the precise cause.  I am guessing that the above code is supposed to be more like this:  JS_PUBLIC_API(void) JS_GC(JSContext *cx) {     if (!cx->fp) {  PR_FinishArenaPool(&cx->stackPool);       PR_FinishArenaPool(&cx->codePool);       PR_FinishArenaPool(&cx->tempPool);       js_ForceGC(cx);     } }  PLEASE let me know if this is correct or not, and if not, what a better solution might be.

I'm going to mark this one wontfix -  crashes in the javascript GC can be caused by just about anything in the program; e.g. another part of the program frees something that the GC thinks it owns.  Given that the codebase now is much changed from the original mozilla classic codebase, it's not too likely that this particular bug is still around. (Though many similar ones may still be.)  If you notice that our current build has the same problem, please line up a reproducible testcase and file another bug against me.
