The keyboard short-cut ALT-W, which used to work in Netscape 3.X, no longer works in Netscape 4.X or any version of Mozilla. In exasperation (after getting a lot of source/info windows left around in a session !), I eventually had to reconfigure my window manager to support \"Kill Window\", but it's an inconvenient way to close the offending windows. Not sure if this applies to HP-UX only, but it's annoying enough to stop me using Netscape 4.X or Mozilla !  BTW, I can't search the View->Page Source window, which is maddening ! The PC version can do this (with a bit of trickery...it's non-obvious on that platform though), but the UNIX one can't ! I end up having to save the HTML source to a file and grep'ing it (for links, tags etc), which is ridiculous.","id":1525,"bug_id":537,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Sep 08 10:40:59 EEST 1998","creator":"ramiro@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"ramiro@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Sep 08 10:40:59 EEST 1998","text":"Reassign to slamm@netscape.com","id":1526,"bug_id":537,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Sep 09 16:44:59 EEST 1998","creator":"slamm@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"slamm@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Sep 09 16:44:59 EEST 1998","text":"Marking assigned.","id":1527,"bug_id":537,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Sep 09 16:44:59 EEST 1998","creator":"slamm@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"slamm@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Wed Sep 09 16:44:59 EEST 1998","text":"*** Bug 102 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***","id":1528,"bug_id":537,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Mon Sep 21 17:26:59 EEST 1998","creator":"slamm@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"slamm@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Mon Sep 21 17:26:59 EEST 1998","text":"The keyboard shortcut have been fixed.
