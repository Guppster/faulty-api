It looks like the width of the arrow is not taken into account.  For an example with screenshot, see   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/People/dkindred/bugs/menu-width.html Updated by Ramiro Estrugo (ramiro@netscape.com) on Wednesday, April 29, 1998 2:46:32 AM PDT Additional Details : Assign to ramiro.  Yes the combo box sucks and has lots of bugs.

In fact, I was just wondering about the comment that you made on replacing ComboBox at all. If you have something else to plug in already, we might just as well \"leave the ComboBox bugs be\". Otherwise, we could fix ComboBox. I'll volunteer to fix bugs on it, but obviously this wouldn't make sense if you throw the whole thing out anyway. So, what's your opinion on that?","id":174,"bug_id":123,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Sep 11 15:14:59 EEST 1998","creator":"thehelix@yahoo.com","author":"thehelix@yahoo.com","time":"Fri Sep 11 15:14:59 EEST 1998","text":"I know why ComboBox sometimes isn't wide enough, and why it's sometimes wider than it should be, depending on the font being used.  The problem is that ComboBox tries to calculate the maximum length of the box by going through all of the strings in the list and calculating the size based on the current font.  HOWEVER: the font used to calculate the maximum length is wrong - it's always the same one. The function where the font is calculated is called  static void SetMaximumLabelSize(DtComboBoxPart *combo_p)  in DtWidgets/ComboBox.c  Later on, the font is assigned correctly. But is should have been assigned already when the ComboBox size is calculated. I will plunge a bit deeper into this.","id":175,"bug_id":123,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Dec 15 07:18:59 EET 1998","creator":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"paulmac@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Tue Dec 15 07:18:59 EET 1998","text":"Old bug, old codebase.
