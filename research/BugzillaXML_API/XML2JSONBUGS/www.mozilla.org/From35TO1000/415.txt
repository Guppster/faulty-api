Based on the resolution of the resolved bug that you mention, it seems like this is an area where the client functions exposed to javascript differ between Netscape and IE.  'goSubmit is not defined' may imply that the Netscape browser does not define the 'goSubmit' function, and there is another method of accomplishing the same thing.  (May I assume that you developed the .asp page using the IE browser?)  I would suggest that you use one of several javascript libraries that attempt to abstract the different browsers.
