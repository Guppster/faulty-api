Used -O for optimization and also both statically/dynamically linked Motif with both moz-export and mozilla-export.  When using two netscape windows or one netscape window and a download window the browser will not click urls properly if downloading of data is taking place in the other window.  It strangely will work if I click the link with the right mouse button instead of the left which will only highlight the link like it has been visited and wait untill the other is done downloading or browsing.  The menu still pops up for the right button but it will work when the left one will not.  Also if I click the middle button(3 button mouse) it cancels the link highlight mentioned above when the left button was clicked on the link.","id":16,"bug_id":41,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sun Aug 30 10:23:59 EEST 1998","creator":"mcafee@gmail.com","author":"mcafee@gmail.com","time":"Sun Aug 30 10:23:59 EEST 1998","text":"Yeah I can believe this is happening.","id":17,"bug_id":41,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Dec 12 17:07:59 EET 1998","creator":"mcafee@gmail.com","author":"mcafee@gmail.com","time":"Sat Dec 12 17:07:59 EET 1998","text":"N/A in new world.","id":18,"bug_id":41,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Feb 26 20:55:59 EET 1999","creator":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"leger@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Feb 26 20:55:59 EET 1999","text":"Marking Verified/Won't Fix","id":19,"bug_id":41,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Wed Apr 16 13:31:21 EEST 2003","creator":"olefemmy@mail.com","author":"olefemmy@mail.com","time":"Wed Apr 16 13:31:21 EEST 2003","text":"I am configuring DNS server on a linux machine running redhat 8.0 distribution.
