On Digital UNIX, CCC includes the \"-x cxx\" option, which does not understand that .so files are not cxx files (it does understand .o and .a files). Therefore those makefiles fail on Digital UNIX.  My quick fix after finding the first one was to find the rest and to add \"-x none\" to the \"$(CCC) -o\" command. However modifying the Makefiles to use the save targets that all other Makefiles use is the correct fix.","id":1359,"bug_id":491,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Sep 05 08:18:59 EEST 1998","creator":"briano@bluemartini.com","author":"briano@bluemartini.com","time":"Sat Sep 05 08:18:59 EEST 1998","text":"I can't find a \"-x cxx\" anywhere anymore.
