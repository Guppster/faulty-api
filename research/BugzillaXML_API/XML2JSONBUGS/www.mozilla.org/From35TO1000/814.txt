This is described in [1]:       If the current box is left-floating, and there are any left      floating boxes generated by elements earlier in the source document,      then for each such earlier box, either the left outer edge of the      current box must be to the right of the right outer edge of the      earlier box, or its top must be lower than the bottom of the      earlier box. Analogous rules hold for right-floating boxes.  [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visuren.html#floats  I know this is different from how NS traditionally lays out floating images. I think the time has come to change that behavior -- or, alternatively -- let floating text elements behave differently from floating images.","id":3081,"bug_id":814,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Oct 03 00:21:59 EEST 1998","creator":"kipp@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"kipp@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Sat Oct 03 00:21:59 EEST 1998","text":"*** Bug 999 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***","id":3082,"bug_id":814,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Oct 03 22:57:59 EEST 1998","creator":"angus@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"angus@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Sat Oct 03 22:57:59 EEST 1998","text":"Adding additional test cases for floats: http://www.webstandards.org/~samurai/common/shame2/floatclear.html http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/tsd.html http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/w3c.html","id":3083,"bug_id":814,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Fri Dec 04 22:37:59 EET 1998","creator":"gerardok@formerly-netscape.com.tld","author":"gerardok@formerly-netscape.com.tld","time":"Fri Dec 04 22:37:59 EET 1998","text":"Verified in xpviewer.exe 11/30 build.","id":3084,"bug_id":814,"tags":[]}]}
