The include-path doesn't seem to include the alpha/ dir, and several files break when compiling. Updated by Wan-Teh Chang (wtc@netscape.com) on Wednesday, May 6, 1998 8:05:45 PM PDT Additional Details : That #include should probably be written as:     #ifdef OSF1     #include <machine/endian.h>     #endif  That is what we do in mozilla/nsprpub/pr/include/prinet.h. Updated by Brian Ostrom (briano@netscape.com) on Monday, July 13, 1998 6:01:29 PM PDT Additional Details : I have a potential fix for this problem.  Just a simple change to mozilla/config/OSF1.mk:  OS_INCLUDES = -I/usr/include -I/usr/include/sys -I/usr/include/machine  I haven't tested this yet, and I'm certainly open to any alternatives.  (I threw in the first two simply to be safe, and because I'm paranoid.... ;-) Updated by Brian Ostrom (briano@netscape.com) on Tuesday, July 14, 1998 4:51:58 PM PDT Additional Details : The fix is in place (mozilla/config/OSF1.mk:3.4).","id":521,"bug_id":249,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Dec 26 01:42:37 EET 2000","creator":"bugzilla@mversen.de","author":"bugzilla@mversen.de","time":"Tue Dec 26 01:42:37 EET 2000","text":"mid-air collision ? / bugzilla cleanup Reopening (current State: verified and no resolution) ","id":544984,"bug_id":249,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Dec 26 01:44:07 EET 2000","creator":"bugzilla@mversen.de","author":"bugzilla@mversen.de","time":"Tue Dec 26 01:44:07 EET 2000","text":"fixed","id":544991,"bug_id":249,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Tue Dec 26 01:49:00 EET 2000","creator":"bugzilla@mversen.de","author":"bugzilla@mversen.de","time":"Tue Dec 26 01:49:00 EET 2000","text":"verified","id":545004,"bug_id":249,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Jan 06 05:37:07 EET 2001","creator":"jruderman@gmail.com","author":"jruderman@gmail.com","time":"Sat Jan 06 05:37:07 EET 2001","text":"*** Bug 299 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***","id":553892,"bug_id":249,"tags":[]},{"is_private":false,"creation_time":"Sat Jan 06 05:41:49 EET 2001","creator":"jruderman@gmail.com","author":"jruderman@gmail.com","time":"Sat Jan 06 05:41:49 EET 2001","text":"*** Bug 469 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***","id":553896,"bug_id":249,"tags":[]}]}
